###Rachel has so many funny stories about Mr Logan, but this one is definitely captures his character the best! 

Loggie bear (our nickname for him) loves his holidays, especially the beach. The sun was high in the sky, birds were singing and the beach was filled with pooches. A spritely Collie ran around Logan and bowed at his feet. Not wanting to appear rude, he bowed back and they chased each other down the damp yellow sands. The Collie darted here and there, leaving Logan in his wake. 

> Rapturous **laughter** ensued from the crowds

Logan could not keep up and proceeded to hunker down and just run. You could hear the power, that ran through his muscle-bound legs, transferring into the wet tightly bound sand. As he hit his terminal velocity, the Collie unfortunately chose to run in Loganâ€™s path. With a loud thud, they collided. Like tumble weeds they rolled, at speed, into the sea. Coming up for air they both had a look of horror on their faces that was reflected on mine. Rapturous laughter ensued from the crowds that had gathered to watch them. Luckily the only thing that had gotten hurt was their pride! As a family, we can honestly say that he has brought so much love into our lives that we would not be without him.
