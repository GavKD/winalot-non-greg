###Despite his size, Sonny is great at playing hide and seek. Luckily, Jo is always there to find him! 

Sonny is a massive German Shephard cross. He was rescued as a puppy from a hoarder’s house. To make himself feel safe, he likes to wedge himself into very small spaces, like under a little side table or under your legs if they’re on the coffee table. Sometimes if he’s really brave, he disappears under my daughter’s bed (I wouldn’t go under there!). 

> He **brings** us all **together**

He brings us all together as a family and we have the best time together out walking and having adventures. He won’t let the kids out of his sight, so we play hide and seek with him and he is very good! He also seems to know if you aren’t happy, and will nudge his way in for a cuddle under your elbow.
