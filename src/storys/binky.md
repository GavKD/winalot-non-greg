###Binky and Anna have been there for each other through both good times and bad, sharing a bond unlike any other.  

Binky is nearly blind and tends to follow me closely due to her poor sight. She has been my rock through the time I’ve had her. When my first husband died 10 years ago, she was the reason I had to get out of bed each day. She spent many a day just sitting and being with me through that. 

> She has been my **rock**

My new husband wasn’t a dog lover, but he has become one now (he had to!). Binky loves chasing a ball, even though I have to throw it very slowly now to ensure she can see it. I’ve taught her tricks, like rolling over and dying, and even how to catch biscuits, which makes it look like she is well trained, but in fact she is still quite naughty at times!
