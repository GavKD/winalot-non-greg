###Tilly may seem cute and innocent, but she definitely reigns supreme in Anna’s house!

I wouldn’t be without my dog Tilly. Last year I had a nasty car accident and she got me through the low times. She’s full of mischief and such a great character. She’s not perfect – she’s got a crossbite so often shows off her tiny teeth – but she’s perfect to me.

> She **got me through** the low times

Tilly is very affectionate. She loves to have a cuddle and be carried around. Though she’s also a very stubborn girl. She’s very much the boss of the family and has to be first with everything. She’ll often bite her ‘brother’ Scrappy’s ears, but he loves her just as I do. During the spring days, she loves to garden – digging holes and rolling in the mud!
