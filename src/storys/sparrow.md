###Sparrow tries to be as sneaky as possible, but Carly always manages to catch him out!

Sparrow is my gorgeous rescue dog from Romania, and I do not know what I’d do without him. He’s cheeky, energetic and a little bit naughty! He gets me outdoors every day, and we love nothing more than long beautiful countryside walks at the weekend. 

> He's **cheeky, energetic** and a little bit **naughty!**

Sparrow is funny because he loves to eat cat food, and he’ll be as sneaky as possible to get to it. As soon as I’m out of the room he’ll sneak up in the dressing table where it’s kept and eat it as fast as he possibly can. Then he hears me coming back and jumps back to the floor and lies down really quickly, like he was never up to anything. He gets this look on his face as if to say ‘I wasn’t doing anything, just lying here chilling!’
