###Whether it’s foraging or exploring rockpools, Doberman Shepherd Cross Eva and her owner Jacqueline love the great outdoors...

Eva is our beautiful Doberman Shepherd Cross. My favourite things about her are her wonderful ‘one up, one down’ ears. She has one sticky up German Shepherd ear and one floppy Doberman ear, which attract a lot of attention and really show she is a cross-breed. 

> Our **favourite** thing to do **together** is to **forage** in the wood

She likes nothing better than exploring rock pools and our favourite thing to do together is to forage in the woods at the back of our house. 

I’m sure Eva would make a fabulous truffle hound. If I’m blackberrying she joins in with the picking and loves eating the berries. However, chestnut hunting is a challenge with their prickly golden jackets! Of course, we’re always vigilant and careful about what she may find.
