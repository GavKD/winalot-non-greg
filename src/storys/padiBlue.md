###Best friends Padi and Blue are two smart pups, who won’t let their owner Lana get away with anything! 

Padi will be 13 in March, but he’s still our baby. We adopted Blue four years ago to keep Padi company and it has been the best thing we’ve done, as it really has kept him young. Although Blue is now nearly nine or 10, we think they still play like puppies! 

> They still **play** like **puppies**

They are so switched on – they know exactly what you are thinking at all times and are so clever. We went through a stage of spelling things out instead of saying them, but they still worked out what we were talking about! 

In the last few weeks, Padi has started to lose his hearing, but he is making sure everyone knows it by barking at everything he does hear. It’s heart-breaking to see that age is finally catching up to him, so are going to make this year as good as possible for him
