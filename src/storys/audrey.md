###Audrey might be a little misshapen, but this just makes her all the more lovable to Jane.

Audrey is a wonky dog. At around six months, I noticed she couldn’t open her mouth fully to yawn or pick up a tennis ball. She had X-rays which revealed a congenital deformity — her jaw is fused to her skull. However, this does not stop us having fun.  

> She creates **laughter** with her **bouncing** walk

People always remark that she’s the happiest dog they’ve ever seen, and she creates laughter with her bouncing walk and long tongue wherever we go. She’s enriched my life so much, and makes me happy every day.
