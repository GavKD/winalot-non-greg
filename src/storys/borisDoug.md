###Two dogs can be a handful, but bringing Boris and Doug into her home was the best decision Jessica’s ever made.

We made the risky choice to pick up two puppies on the same day, despite almost everyone telling us we were insane. But it was the best decision we ever made! We wanted to get two dogs so they could keep each other company when we went out, and they’ve done that and much more. They spend their days cuddling up together and just love each other so much. They have the best bond.

> They have the **best bond**

When we were on the beach recently, a bigger dog tried to jump on our little Labrador Boris, but Doug the Dalmation ran straight over to push him off. It was funny because Boris is usually the braver one, and Doug often runs away scared from puppies trying to play with him! They just love being together and it’s so lovely for us to witness!
