###Dee has brought out the best in her rescue dog Jackson, and now he is a role model for all of his foster brothers.  

We adopted Jackson from a charity called Safe Rescue for Dogs needing homes. We were ready for a dog and our only stipulation was that it had to be a rescue dog. Jackson had come from Romania after being caught by the dog catchers and living in a pound over there for four years. 

> He is always trying to **protect** his **family**

Jackson is a loyal and loving dog, but has many anxieties caused by his past. He is reactive, and he is always trying to protect his family. We have worked hard and he now loves his walks and is more confident. Before adopting him, we knew nothing of the plight of the poor dogs over in Romania, but once our eyes were opened we had to try to help in some way. This year we started to foster for Safe Rescue and now have our sixth foster dog. Jackson has been an amazing brother to all our foster dogs and this was something that has astounded us. He is very special.
