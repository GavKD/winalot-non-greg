###Merry might have been a distraction from Emma’s studies, but his friendship is unrivalled and his love for life infectious.  

Merry is my best friend. I got him in my third year of university (getting a puppy is a terrible idea when you have coursework to do!). He was definitely a handful but 4 years later I have the funniest, most loving dog imaginable. He comes everywhere with my and is my little shadow. If it’s not dog-friendly, I’m not going!

Merry loves to swim and is always in and out of the sea when we go to the beach. I think he is half dog and half seal! Even better than swimming is diving to fish out rocks from the bottom of any body of water and hoarding them in a pile!

 He also loves a good pose for his Instagram page which I set up as a joke after my boyfriend told me I needed to post photos of something other than my dog on my own page!  We spend lots of time exploring the countryside where we live or hiking in the hills of the Lake District which isn’t too far away from us.

Getting a dog made me realise how stressed and anxious I felt about day to day life a lot of the time, simply by making it go away. Merry is my anchor and I think he is the best dog in the world!
