###Maple has given Claire the confidence she needed to live her life to the full, and she is always there for a cuddle. 

We got Maple after I was diagnosed with depression, and she has been by my side ever since. While she was still a puppy I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and was housebound for over a month while I recovered from a relapse. She gave me the confidence to go out, as when I had Maple with me I was not alone. 

> She gave me the **confidence** to go out

Over time, Maple has come to know if I am experiencing any symptoms, and she will lay on the affected area. Sometimes she even knows before I experience any problems that something is about to happen, and will come and lay on me. 

Maple has helped me adjust to life with a disability, she doesn’t mind if I’m having a bad day with lots of symptoms, it means extra cuddles for her! She has got used to walks alongside my mobility scooter and will even drop toys on the sofa when we are playing so I don’t have to bend down and she can still play fetch and catch.
