###Dea’s Doberman Ferdie is proof that you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.

20-week-old Ferdie was a hard decision to make honestly. We lost our previous dog three years ago and were heartbroken. He had been a rescue dog and no other could replace him. We agreed to wait until we had more time on our hands before we would consider getting another. We occasionally talked about getting a dog but that was as far as it went until we were told about some Doberman puppies. I was very reluctant as I wasn’t used to a large breed of dog and I’d heard some (incorrect) bad press stories about the Doberman dogs. My partner was more enthusiastic than I was but we decided to go and investigate. And, as they say, we never looked back!

> He has given us a **new lease of life**

This charming boy came along at just the right time. He has given us a new lease of life. Like any puppy he’s been hard work, but we’ve been rewarded with the most gentle and soppiest of dogs. There’s not an aggressive bone in his body and he has such a lust for life. In fact, he’s got so little aggression that all his toys remain intact. He has one downfall though – he’s not keen on getting his feet wet and we live right by the sea. Even damp sand causes a disdainful look! He is a regular window ornament and likes nothing more than to lie there and watch the world go by. I have plenty of doggy nose art to clean on a daily basis!
