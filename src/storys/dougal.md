###Donna is inspired by how stoic Dougal has been in facing his fears head-on and living his life to the full.   

Dougal is a Romanian rescue who had never been socialised outside a kennel before I got him. He was terrified of the world, of puddles, lampposts, open spaces, woods, the TV – literally everything. 

> Brings me **back** down to **earth**

He inspires me daily by the courage he showed me in overcoming those fears. He never fails to put the hugest smile in my heart and eyes when I see him happily dash through ditches, go up and down mountains, bash out the sand dunes, explore forests and play with other dogs. He reminds me to never let my fears stop me. 

His overwhelming pleasure in normal life catches me and makes everything else that might be troubling me just melt away. Dougal brings me back down to earth when my head takes me where it doesn’t need to go. I am self-employed and work from home, which can be quite isolating. Dougal makes me go outside and look for beautiful new walks. He gets me seeing sights I wouldn’t otherwise seek, and talking to people I wouldn’t otherwise meet. I honestly can’t express how much difference Dougal makes to my life. I would be lost without him.
