###Missy was Katie’s motivation to get better and keep fighting, and thanks to her friendship Katie is now thriving and enjoying life once more.  

We rescued Missy when she was just over a year old after having spent five months at the rescue centre. When we first went to visit her, she gave us her paw and that was it - she had chosen us!

The day before we brought her home, I was diagnosed with an eating disorder and had to stop going to school and doing any activity. Missy was and still is my motivation to keep going each day. I had to build up my strength to be able to go out with her and she was always by my side when I was upset or struggling. I had to spend months in a hospital miles away from home and it was her visits that gave me the power to fight. She was also a comfort for my family during those difficult times and helped them to go out and get fresh air each day.

> Gave me the **power** to **fight**

We regularly take Missy to obedience classes and she passed her Gold Kennel Club Good Citizen Award last October, which is a huge achievement for an Akita! We are now training her to become a therapy dog so she can visit hospitals and school to help others like she helps me.

I am now going to university in September to study veterinary medicine, something I never thought was possible a couple of years ago and I couldn’t have done it without my Missy.
