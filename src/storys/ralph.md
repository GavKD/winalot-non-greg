###Melissa’s socks may ‘mysteriously disappear’ now that Ralph is in her life. But, with the joy he brings to the family, she wouldn’t have it any other way.

Ralph is a ball of energy. We got Ralph in October 2019 and since then he’s been super good at pinching socks and reading the newspaper.

My mum suffers from anxiety at times and we thought a dog would help her get out more on walks as she wouldn’t be alone. Ralph has brought so much joy to mum without realising it. It’s amazing. She’s a brighter person now and doesn't think twice about nipping out with her little shadow.

Playtime for Ralph is all day. He loves to play with his rope and ball but he can be clumsy at times.

> Ralph has **brought so much joy** to mum without realising it

Ralph has mastered ‘sit’ and ‘shake a paw’ but doesn’t quite understand no the socks are mine!

Ralph is the perfect family-friendly dog. If we don’t take him to my Nan’s house for Sunday lunch, she wants to know why he’s not there. He’s fab around our niece who’s eight. They adore each other and play all day.

Ralph is the best thing we’ve ever got.
