###Supporting students is child’s play now that Karyn’s got Edison by her side!

My dog Edison – a four-year-old Yorkshire terrier – is our school dog at The Griffin Federation. He has been with us since he was nine weeks’ old.

The difference he makes to our children is incredible, particularly the vulnerable children in our care. With most schools closed, Edison is getting a little frustrated as he’s not able to come to school every day. But he’s been busy recording messages for the children who need a bit of extra support. It is really is helping.

He’s also been a huge comfort in my life. We deal with quite harrowing situations which have ranged from the death of one of our staff members to dealing with grieving pupils. This little dog greets you every day with a wagging tail and a kiss. It’s just what I need some days, particularly when you feel like you’ve given so much to others that you just need a little back. When this happens, you need look no further than Edison’s little face.

Now being a school dog doesn’t mean he’s well behaved. With the children he is amazing – but he is very, very mischievous! He’s had several trips to the vets for eating things he shouldn’t. He chews everything. His favourite thing is to jump on my school desk and steal pens. Despite his naughtiness I love him and so do our 350 kids!
