###Frankie provided unrivalled friendship to his brother Archie, staying by his side even through the toughest of times. 

In his early days, Frankie was nicknamed the ‘Andrex puppy’. My friend and I had been out, and when I came back home the hall was completely white. Frankie had gone into the bathroom and dragged a 12 pack of toilet rolls around the house – you couldn’t see the floor! All he could do was wag his tail at me as he sat on the edge of the bed as if butter wouldn’t melt. 

> Frankie **wouldn’t** go **without** him

In May Archie suffered a stroke. After reviving him and taking him to the vets, we didn’t expect him to survive but brought him home because his fighting spirit was in the evidence.Archie was too ill to walk, but Frankie wouldn’t go without him, so we had to get a buggy for Archie to lie in so that Frankie could happily walk alongside his friend. Frankie was a bit of a cuddle hog, but each time Archie took a turn Frankie would sit beside him quietly and snuggle so that Archie would know his friend was there.
