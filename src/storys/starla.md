###Aruni has a fresh perspective on life now that Starla has joined the family.

Our Cockapoo Starla is a one-in-a-million dog! She's my very first pet, and she has completely changed my perspective on life.

I can now understand why other dog owners love their pets so much and treat them as a member of their own family. She brings so much love, joy and happiness to our family, and brings us closer together! She is such a positive influence.

We've had several visits from friends who are not used to pets. However, everyone who has met Starla has had their hearts touched by her, and they leave with such kind words. She is definitely a people person.

During lockdown, I’ve been able to work from home and use my lunch break to take her for daily walks in our nearby playing fields. It's amazing how she knows when it's time to leave. She comes and puts her face on my knees while I'm seated, and looks up at me with those big brown eyes, as if to remind me. 

If it wasn't for Starla, I wouldn't be getting out daily and this has really stimulated and improved my mental health. She really makes me feel in such a fabulous mood.

So thank you Starla, from the bottom of my heart, for making such a wonderful and positive difference to our family's lives and to the life of anyone you meet.
