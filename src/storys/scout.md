###Tracey is so proud of her rescue dog Scout, who is always looking out for other people.

Scout is my best friend and my hero. Born with very little sight, he was abandoned on the streets as a young puppy. Narrowly escaping death in a pound, his life was eventually saved by the combined effort of three amazing rescue organisations. 

> Scout has an enormous **zest** for life

Scout has an enormous zest for life and enjoys every single day. Fundraiser, much-loved therapy dog and heart-melter, he is living proof that dogs with disabilities can live a full and normal life. Scout has taught me so much and I am a better person because of him.
