###George the boxer dog found his forever home with the Foremans.

I’m a pet portrait artist based in Surrey. I began drawing animals five years ago. 

My customers always asked me what animals I had. At the time I had a Guinea pig, and I kept thinking about getting a dog, so we went to Battersea and contacted several rescues when one day my friend told me about a boxer that needed rehoming. 

> We **love** him to **bits**

We decided to go for it. He came to us at six months from a family that couldn’t take care of him. He came with the name George, which went so well with our surname Foreman! We are now the proud owners of George Foreman the boxer dog. He’s so loving and gentle, and although he’s a bit tricky to walk, we love him to bits.
