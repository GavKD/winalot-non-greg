###Although Ares has a cheeky side, he’s also extremely compassionate and couldn’t be more protective of Aliyah. 

I got Ares as a wedding present. We later found out that he was actually born the day we got married! 

He is great at doing his little tricks. He is very fond of imitating farm animals – he sometimes quacks, oinks, and even tries to do a little cockerel noise in the morning! He’s also a great little brother to his cat sister – they play all the time, but she won’t quite give him a cuddle.

He is the best boy I’ve ever had. I had spinal surgery after I broke my back, and it had me at home for a few months. Ares could tell something was up. Normally, he’s quite a sassy little dog and once he’s got attention will just leave, but during this time not once did he leave my side. I would have been in a much darker place if it wasn’t for him. He’s the reason I go outside and push myself to get stronger every day.
