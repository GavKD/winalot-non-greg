###Nala is full of character and has lots of quirky habits, but most importantly she’s had a very positive influence on Katherine’s life.   

Nala is a rescue from Cyprus, and I felt so blessed by her existence that I began volunteering for the company who rescues the dogs. I volunteer there every week and it’s such a positive influence in my life when I work a very stressful job. 

> An absolute **diva** and a total **princess**

She is an absolute diva and a total princess. Every morning when our alarm goes off, she gets into a small spook position in my husband’s arms and nuzzles us both. Her paws smell like digestive biscuits and popcorn, and it’s our favourite smell! 

She has lots of funny habits. We call her a ‘scarf’ as she has a habit of walking up on the bed behind our necks and wrapping herself around us like a scarf! A very fluffy, warm scarf. She also hops every third step – she’s not in pain, it’s just a little quirk! 

We call her ‘Bubba’ for short, and now she responds to that instead of her real name!
