###Lauren and her family adore Yogi, who makes them laugh with his mischievous nature and love of doughnuts! 

Yogi came to us at 10 months old after his first family ran out of time for him. He is an absolute joy who lights up our lives! 

> He’s **super** cheeky

The first toy we gave him was a plush doughnut, which he goes to bed with every night –every morning after his toilet break he proudly grabs it from his bed and runs upstairs to present either mum or dad with it with a couple of ear licks and a wagging tail. 

He’s super cheeky and loves a game of chase, whether that be with a sock, wet wipe, glove or other item he shouldn’t have! We are currently managing his stress levels, as he can have a tendency to bark at new people or dogs in unfamiliar surroundings.
