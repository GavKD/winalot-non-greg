###When Fern joined the family, she changed their lives for the better, providing unrivalled support and understanding for Hayley’s son Leon.  

Fern joined our family to help with our falconry business, but this clever little Cocker Spaniel had another job in mind. She instantly took to our autistic little boy who was locked inside himself with no words or ways of communication. They quickly formed an amazing bond — Fern has undergone a lot of specialist training, and she is now Leon’s assistance dog. 

> A **bond** like no other

Fern and Leon love spending time together and can usually be found in a muddy puddle. They have a bond like no other. Since Fern joined our family, Leon has started talking and interacting. His doctors are amazed with his progress and so are we, and it’s all thanks to his friend with four paws.
