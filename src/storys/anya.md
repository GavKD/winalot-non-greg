###Dealing with aches and pains can take its toll on Sharon, but when Anya licks away her tears, everything seems a little bit easier.

Anya is a Blue Merle Collie and my little friend. I am disabled and have painful illnesses. If I cry, Anya will come running, lick my tears and cuddle me just like a human would.

She’s an amazing, sensible dog. She has many quirky traits that make us laugh. Every single night before bedtime, Anya comes to me, gives me a paw and licks her lips so that I’ll tell her dad to give her some gravy bone biscuits. As soon as she’s had them, she’s happy to go to sleep. If I take ill in the night and need my oxygen, Anya comes to me and puts her head on my knee so I can try and concentrate on tickling her when my pain is very bad.

> I’m **so blessed** with Anya

I’m so blessed with Anya. She’s a funny, kind dog and I do believe that she’s knows everything we say. Anya knows when my Facebook app rings that someone’s going to video call us. She’ll run and greet the person by licking my screen to give them kisses. She loves going for drives in the car as well. She sits on the back seat with her dog harness on and watches for wildlife. She loves sheep and lowly barks when she sees them.
