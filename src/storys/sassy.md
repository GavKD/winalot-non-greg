###Sophie adopted Sassy when she was going through a rough patch, and he helped get her out and about and loving life again.

We re-homed our Jack Russell Sassy when she was five months old, and she has been our waggy companion for three years now. 

Shortly after we got her, my partner and I were feeling pretty discontent with our jobs and situation, so we packed our rucksacks and decided to take Sassy on the longest walk ever – 1,000 miles from Lands End to John O’Groats. It was amazing but tough, walking long days in all weathers, and Sassy really helped to keep us going. When we were soaking wet and on the verge of giving up, watching her waggy tail charging along the paths and how happy she was really gave us the boost we needed to carry on. She was an absolute trooper on her four little legs – we think she might even have been the smallest dog to walk that route! 

> She **improves** the **wellbeing** of everyone

With our adventure behind us and back to the grindstone, Sassy brings us joy every day. She comes to work with us where she improves the wellbeing of everyone in the office. In meetings, she will make sure she spends a bit of time sitting on everyone’s lap. It usually goes down well, apart from when she leaves her little white hairs all over your trousers! 

Although she is small, she is the greediest dog I know and will wake us up every morning by jumping on us in bed and sitting on our chests, staring into our eyes until we make her breakfast! Good job she is cute and can just about get away with it! 

Sassy is the best. She is the reason we get up and out walking, even on the wettest and windiest days. She never fails to put a smile on our faces.
