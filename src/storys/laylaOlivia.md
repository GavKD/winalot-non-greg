###Layla is Olivia’s very own beam of happiness, spreading the joy around wherever she goes.  

Layla is a miniature sausage dog – but she has the personality of a Great Dane! She walks into a room and has a huge impact on everyone around her – she likes to make sure you know she is there! She is a qualified PAT (Pets as Therapy) dog and goes into nursing homes and hospitals to provide pet therapy to patients, providing joy and happiness. 

> Providing **joy** and **happiness** 

She is also very caring and intuitive. If she senses you are upset or stressed, she will climb up to you and give you a cuddle. When my dad had a brain haemorrhage last year when he was home alone, she did not leave his side and stayed with him until the ambulance got there. Luckily, he made a full recovery and she was very excited at his return!
