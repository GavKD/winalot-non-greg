###Even on Beccaâ€™s darker days, the sun shines a little brighter now she has Milo and Cora in her life.

I have two dogs, Milo and Cora. Milo is a four-year-old beagle and Cora is a three-month-old chocolate Labrador. Just before I got my dogs, I was diagnosed with anxiety, severe depression and I was on a high dose of medication.

My dogs literally saved my life. They give me purpose and responsibility. And on days where I didn't feel like getting up, I had to get up for them. They were a positive influence and the reason I am now happy, healthy and follow a good active lifestyle.

> My dogs **literally saved my life**

My life revolves around my dogs: what car I buy, where I can stay, what restaurants I can eat at all depends on them. They come everywhere with me. They are huge characters and have a lovely life in the highlands of Scotland.

They have four bowls of fresh water dotted around the house. But they still insist on jumping in the bath and drinking the running water. A holiday with them is just what I need.
