###Hayley adores how friendly Mckinley is to everyone he meets, brightening up everyone’s day on his walks through the local neighbourhood. 

Mckinley is our gentle giant! He brings so much joy into our lives and to everyone he meets. I can’t remember a dog walk when someone didn’t stop us to say hello and have a stroke, and now he’s come to expect it! Whether it’s a family on an afternoon stroll, or an elderly person on their way to the shops, we get to meet a lot of different people and have a natter. I like to think he brings a bit of joy into their lives for that day. 

> A **wave*** and a **wagtail*** 

We now actively avoid walks where we are on our own, as we like to meet people and say hello. Everyone in our local area knows Mckinley and will give him a wave as they pass us. We even give the elderly gentleman in the care home window a wave and wagtail every day as well! 

He is certainly a dog we will never forget and is very unique. The thing with his breed is even though they are sociable, loyal and friendly, they also like to do things on their terms so it’s all down to him and the fact that he likes to meet the people. I also think it has something to do with all the back rubs he gets as well!
