###Deborah has a spring in her step thanks to Milo’s lively antics.

Last year, we lost our Miniature Schnauzer Holly after 12 years together. We were utterly bereft and knew we had to grieve. But we also knew that we eventually needed another dog in our lives. Milo – a very lively black Miniature Schnauzer pup – arrived a few months later. 

We joke that he came with an extra pack of Duracell, because he’s so energetic! Although he sleeps all night, in the day he naps with one eye open.

> He’s a **real character** for sure!

I have a bad back and can’t work, so he's a great companion. We have a big garden he can romp around in – although he needs to stop trying to eat the bees! He loves his walks through the green fields that surround our village, and it gives my hubby a great excuse for some fresh air and exercise.

Milo loves football and playing fetch, which is not a typical Schnauzer trait (they usually run off with the ball)! We also take him to puppy class and a KC Bronze Award Class, which he has just passed. I think we’ll try an agility class next because I’ve never seen a small dog jump as far or as high as he can. He's a real character for sure!
