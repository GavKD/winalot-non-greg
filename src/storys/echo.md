###Echo might love the limelight and attention from strangers, but Emba will always be her favourite human. 

Echo is so full of bean and is such a character! She loves staring at trees (aka tree-derping). If we let her, she would do it all day long. She’s also a bit of an attention-seeker and will throw herself at people walking past. 

> An **attention**-seeker

She is now nicknamed ‘tripod’ and ‘hoppy’ after having her front right leg amputated in October 2019 – not that you would know, the way she hares across the woodlands!
