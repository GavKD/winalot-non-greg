###Deborah is endlessly amused by her cheeky dog Petey, who knows exactly how to get his own way!  

Petey is a bundle of joy who cheers me up and motivates me if I’m a bit down. He can be a complete clown, upturning his water dish if it’s empty and then tapping it on the floor, or coming in from the back garden – where he’s been digging for England – looking like he’s been down a coal pit. He even moves side to side while I’m tickling his chest to ensure that it’s being done thoroughly and I don’t miss a spot. 

> He can be a complete **clown**

He can be selectively deaf, too. He thinks that if he lies down and puts his head in his paws, he can’t be seen – especially when I’ve asked him to go out. I love him to bits and am so glad he came into my life.
