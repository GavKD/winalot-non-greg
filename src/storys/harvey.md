###Emma and her dog Harvey enjoy going on adventures everywhere together – from the countryside to the beach, and even on the tube!  

Harvey is a 10-month-old Golden Retriever pup. We haven’t had him for long, but he’s already been on lots of adventures with us – he was visiting places like Whitby and the Lake District as soon as he was vaccinated and ready for the world! 

> He loves to **travel** on the **tube**

We live in busy London and he loves to travel on the tube and bus because he knows that’s where he gets all the cuddles. He’s got the friendliest personality and the biggest smile, and never fails to make people smile with his, especially when he’s being carried by his dad on the escalator! 

Harvey’s best friend is his litter mate (or rather brother) Joey, and we’re so lucky to get to know another young couple like us who have adopted one of these high-energy pups!
