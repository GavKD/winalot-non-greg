###Millie the mad mini dog is the perfect addition to Emma’s family. 

We got Millie when she was just nine weeks old and we knew from day one our life was going to change for the better. 

> Millie has a **crazy** yet **lovely** personality

Millie has a crazy yet lovely personality. She adores her dad Zac when she wants to play and adores her mum (me) when she wants snuggles. We call her all sorts of names from Millie to Mills to Mill Bobs – she knows them all. It’s just the three of us at the moment and we absolutely love our little family of three!
