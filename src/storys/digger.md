###Digger has fallen head over heels for Louise and her family, attaching himself both to their hearts and their legs. 

Digger joined us for a few weeks before Christmas, and as the snow arrived he warmed our hearts and kept us on our toes. Every morning is a delight – his wonky, whiskery moustache greets us first as he emerges from his bed, and our three walks a day keep my soul and body happy and healthy. 

> His **wonky, whiskery** moustache greets us first 

He has amazing intuition. He’s not that bothered about humans outside the family, but his family are something special and he treats each one of us with huge affection. He knows when everyone is due home from work and hangs around by the front door or window ready for a woof and a tummy tickle. 

He is an expert at moulding himself to you; on your feet if you’re ironing, by your side, one paw on your hand if you’re on the sofa. And yet, he fully accepts that he cannot go upstairs (it’s cat territory) and waits patiently with the occasional ‘harrumph’ to remind you that he’s still there!
