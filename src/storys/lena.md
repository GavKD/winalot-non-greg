###Lena the sassy pup has filled Katieâ€™s life with love and laughter.

Rescued from Romania, where she was attacked as a tiny pup, Lena just lights up my life every minute. Left with facial deformities, she is my little snorting hyena.

> She is my **little snorting hyena**

Seeing how far she has come in the (almost) two years since I adopted her gives me such a sense of happiness. She has given me a purpose and something to care for when, at times, I can feel like I am not worth much. Filled with so much sassiness and energy, she is (in my eyes) the best, purest gremlin ever.
