###Everyone knows that Ellie and her dog Evie-Rose make the perfect duo.  

I got my miniature dachshund Evie as a puppy, and we’ve been inseparable ever since. Her full name is Evie-Rose Chipolata, and she has loads of nicknames like Evie-Weevie, Silly Sausage and, because of her size, Pocket Rocket. Her size is one of my favourite things about her, and her ears flap like mad when she runs!

Because of Winalot’s take your dog to work scheme, I’m fortunate enough to be able to bring her into the office, and she’s very much come to define me there. People may not know me, but they know my dog!

> She always **makes <br> me laugh**, makes **great <br> company** when I’m <br>feeling lonely, and is <br>always there for **cuddles**

It’s just us two at home, but she always makes me laugh, makes great company when I’m feeling lonely, and is always there for cuddles. I feel like I have needed a lot of those over the last few months, so she has really got me through. She  also adores my dad if he ever visits, largely because he lets her do anything she wants.

Ultimately what makes her special is that she is a nutcase but the most incredibly affectionate one . She loves every dog and every person she has ever met and is absolutely full of beans dawn ‘til dusk.
