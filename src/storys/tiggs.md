###Tiggs brightens up Jennifer’s day with his endless kisses, so it’s only fair that he gets a carrot as a treat!

Tiggs has helped me get through many sad times in the past years, from my benign brain tumour to the coronavirus lockdown. He has been there for hugs and licks whenever I needed him.

> He **lights up my day** just by being there

He is an amazing, friendly and lovable dog who has been with me from the day he was born – I also owned his parents! Tiggs is an active dog who loves to play, and it always makes me happy when I see him enjoying himself. He loves carrots and eats them often. His bad habits are grinding his teeth and snoring. He is always friendly towards other dogs and people, especially children. He lights up my day just by being there.
