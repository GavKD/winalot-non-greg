###Della knew that owning a dog would make her happy, but she could never have predicted the pure joy that Stanley brings to her and all those around him! 

The search for Stanley started because in addition to wanting to extend our family, I was struggling with my mental health and knew the positive impact a dog can have. What we didn’t anticipate was the ripple of positivity beyond our family. 

Stan is a Miniature Dachshund with a fun, friendly, loving, loyal and sometimes stubborn character. Since our first week of having him, we have never gone without a smile, a giggle or someone asking to stroke him and offer him a biscuit. 


> Completely **blown** us **away**

From the ladies in the hairdressers watching him skip past to the laughing children when he wraps himself around them for strokes, the happiness his little sausage legs bring is contagious and has completely blown us away. 

Stan is adventurous and loves a challenge. He likes to walk on logs in the woods and steal underwear from the laundry basket! He loves learning new tricks and recently graduated from pup school. Adventures take us lots of places and we all love exploring together. The beach, the countryside, the city – anywhere with fun walks followed by great food, and the pack is happy! 

In the morning he likes a warm snuggle in bed before breakfast. He’s little spoon and we’re big spoon! On storm days he just wants to cosy up and watch Paw Patrol on Netflix. 

Stan has changed our life and no matter the day, he brings a smile to us and all those he encounters. He now even has a waiting list of people who are eager to look after him. We’re very grateful for our sausage pooch.
