###Clare was anxious about the recent lockdown, but with Hugo by her side, she knows she can get through anything – even if he does make gardening a bit trickier!

We were lucky to pick up Hugo a few weeks before the Covid-19 pandemic happened – and I'm so glad we did. He has been the perfect housemate for my husband and I. And he has been a really positive influence on my anxiety.

Although he has his moments, he's adapted so well to our new lockdown norm. He’s social when he can meet other dogs on walks. And he’s brave in new situations that he hasn't fully experienced yet because we haven't been allowed to leave the house properly.

I never thought I would be one of those people that owned a dog, let alone a person that would fall so completely head over heels in love with one – even if he does dig up the plants!
