###No matter what’s been thrown at Ethan-James, he’s always been able to rely on his best friend Sasha for support. 

Sasha came into my life as a six-week-old puppy when I was 11 back in 2007. I am severely dyslexic and have several other learning difficulties. Having Sasha by my side gave me the confidence to finally learn to read and start achieving at school. I would sit with her and read and she’d snuggle into me when I struggled pronouncing words or got frustrated. 

> She’s **stood** by my **side**

When I started having seizures at 15 she’d stay with me until I recovered and not leave me alone. Together with my younger dog Shadow we’ve been homeless twice, and she’s stood by my side throughout everything. 

She puts her paw in my lap when I’m not giving her enough attention. She loves water, swimming and playing fetch. Her favourite hobby is ripping tennis balls to shreds, as well as a good gnaw on a bone and a good snooze.
