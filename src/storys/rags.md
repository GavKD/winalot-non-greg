###Rags loves to play and meet new people, and keeps constantly keeps Kathryn on her toes! 

Since we got Rags, she’s been through the mill a bit, but you would never know it due to her zest for life! 

> She’s the most **beautiful** and **sociable** dog

She’s the most beautiful and sociable dog – we can’t walk five yards without someone wanting to fuss her. Her favourite things to do are zoomies in the garden (and if I am feeling brave, the local forest) and digging sand on the beach. 

She loves being fussed over by members of the public and having play dates with her doggy friends in the village.
