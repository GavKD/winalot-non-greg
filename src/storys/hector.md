###Hektor has brought craziness, chaos and a lot of love into Colin’s life, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. 

The ‘heckmonster’ has been with us just over a year – what a year! – and he is a significant part of our family. When he was about four months old, Hektor discovered that he actually quite liked a bit of water to paddle in. Oh, boy! No looking back. The problem now is keeping him dry on a walk! 

> Our lives **revolve** around **him** in the most **magical** way

Mum and I regularly pander to his desire to visit the garden and charge about after tennis balls, inevitably coming back indoors filthy, wet and tired (the first two applying to all of us but the third only to mum and I). Hektor is always totally wired and raring to go! 

He is an absolute joy every minute of every day, and our lives revolve around him in the most magical way. He is asleep on my bed as I write this – taking up most of it as usual – and will no doubt wake me at about six o’clock tomorrow morning. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
