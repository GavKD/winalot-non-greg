###Jenny has nothing but love for her dog Dixie, who is always by her side to support her – even if she does get more likes on Instagram! 

I got Dixie when she was eight weeks old, and although most people told me not to (I was single and working full time), she is the best decision I’ve ever made. She brings so much joy to my life, forces me to get out of the house, calms me when stress threatens to overwhelm and is my absolute love bug. 

> She’s a **pro** at **posing**

She’s a very calm dog (unless there’s a squirrel in her sight) and has been the best ‘first dog’ for my niece and nephew, helping them to overcome their fear of dogs by being patient, calm and loving. 

She’s a pro at posing for the thousands of photos I take of her – she has more followers than me! Nothing makes her happier than being on a beach with the sand between her paws and the sea to paddle in. 

I take her into my office now and again, and the difference in people’s faces when they see a dog is amazing. She actually makes people smile on a Monday morning! 

I’ve been going through IVF over the last year or so and I know I wouldn’t have got through all the ups and downs if she hadn’t been by my side. We truly don’t deserve dogs – and although everyone thinks they have the best dog, I know that I do!
