###Camilla’s Husky Blue has a cheeky grin and a winning personality to boot!    

Blue is a Siberian Husky who we rescued in August 2018. From the moment we met Blue at the rehoming centre, we fell in love. We couldn't say if it was because of his intelligent, kind blue eyes or his uncanny megawatt smile.

We soon discovered that he has one of the best personalities. He is loyal, quick to learn new tricks, trusting and loves a cuddle and a belly scratch. He is a bundle of energy one moment and a chilled out pooch the next. He loves to play and wrestle with other dogs. Blue isn't shy about voicing his opinions or singing along to his favourite song either.

> He’s the **ultimate best friend**

He is the heart of our home. He lives to go everywhere with you – from a walk on the beach or a jog around the park, to a drive in the car or a day in the office. He’s happy as long as he’s with us. He’s the ultimate best friend.
