###Bo may not be the most outgoing of dogs, but he has filled Jenny’s world with a lot of love and laughter in his own special way. 

Bo is the best boy. We have owned him for seven years now and he makes every single day better. He’s not the most outgoing of dogs and is so low-key people often forget he’s in the room, but he adores being fussed and is so loving in his own quiet, calm way. 

> Makes **every** single day **better**

Bo is quirky – he has little habits and routines that make him very ‘Bo-like’ all the time. His best at the moment is that he’s decided, as the grand old boy that he is, that he wants to always have his breakfast in bed, so bounces straight in it as soon as we pick up his bowl! 

Bo is a real silver fox now; his movement is slower, and his hearing and vision are starting to fail. What he will always love is the beach – he has swum in Cornwall and Yorkshire and always dips his tummy into any water on a warm day. As a Cardigan Corgi, he looks unbelievably cute whilst trotting on the sand!
