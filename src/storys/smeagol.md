###Smeagol is 11 years’ old but I first met her as a two-week old puppy. We have shared some sad times and a lot of happy times. But through all the tough times she has been there and made them better.

She is my life, my friend, my love, my cuddle buddy, my hot water bottle and always knows how to make me smile. She loves long walks with Shelby and me. After all these years her howling at the ice cream van and sirens still makes me smile.

She loves swimming too. She smells the river and off she goes. All you hear is a distant splash. Her other love is her ball. If I dare forget it when we go out I cannot even explain the look she gives me.

> The one big thing I love about her is the **unconditional love** she gives me

Every time she hears the kettle, she thinks that’s her cue to get a biscuit. With her big doggie eyes looking at you and her happy dance, she makes it hard to say no.

I honestly feel so thankful to have her in my life. Earlier this year she had a cancerous lump removed from her gum. Thankfully this wasn’t cancer that would spread. She is doing so well now and back to her normal self.

The one big thing I love about her is the unconditional love she gives me.
