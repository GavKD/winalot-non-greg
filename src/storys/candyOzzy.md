###No matter what obstacles life my bring, Sam can’t help but smile when he has a cuddle with Candy and Ozzy.

We rehomed Candy and Ozzy separately after losing our first dog to a liver defect. We’ve had Candy for over 8 years and Ozzy for 7 years.

Both of them have life-long conditions. Candy has hip dysplasia and spondylosis, and Ozzy is epileptic. They are both on daily medications (multiple times a day) and we’ve got to be careful with everything we do. But we wouldn't have it any other way.

If we're struggling mentally and physically, the two of them brighten our day, every day.

> They have both brought **so much happiness** into our lives

Like many others during this difficult time, we are struggling with lockdown and the dogs pick up on our anxiety. But when we are feeling blue, a cuddle on the sofa with them makes it all better.

Candy is the sensible dog and makes sure I never lie in for work (and, more importantly, delay breakfast!). Ozzy, on the other hand, is a lunatic. He travels 100mph wherever we go and does everything with a lot of enthusiasm!

They have both brought so much happiness into our lives, especially when we were in a dark place. They bring light into our lives and whatever problems we face, no matter how big or small, go away when we're with them.
