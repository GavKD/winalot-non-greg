###Karen can’t stop laughing at Neytiri’s lovable antics.

Neytiri is my red Siberian husky. She is very vocal and loves to talk to everyone. Neytiri is my goofball who makes everyone laugh. Sometimes I think she may have been born from a gazelle the way she bounces around like one in the garden. Neytiri is the youngest of four of my dogs. They all have their quirks but Neytiri was definitely sent to make me laugh.

I often have to chase her around the garden when she has decided to raid the kitchen table top, whether it’s a spoon, a food packet or a tea towel.

> It **tugs at my heart strings** when she goes for a **loving kiss** and a **cuddle**

On the other hand, when you’re sat quietly at the kitchen table having a coffee or reading a book, Neytiri will place her head upon your lap and look lovingly into your eyes. It tugs at my heart strings when she goes for a loving kiss and a cuddle. Neytiri's only downfall is she likes to greet all her guests with a WWF-style take down so she can give them sloppy kisses. But despite her faults we love her deeply.
