###Walter’s endless energy gives Emma a run for her money, but she adores him nonetheless. 

Walter makes us laugh every day. Once, whilst out on a walk with my nephew, he managed to slip out from his lead after seeing a deer. He ran around the park for 30 minutes, thinking that my nephew chasing after him was all part of a big game!

> **He** is a **real** loveable **rogue**

He is a real loveable rogue, who has the kindest soul I have ever encountered in a dog. He just wants to be everyone’s friend. 

We enjoy taking long walks, going to work together and snuggling in my bed at night, before I finally manage to settle him down into his own.
