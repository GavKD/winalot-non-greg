###Louise, the proud owner of Teddy the happy Beagle, had to learn the hard way that he will try to eat anything!   

> We **raced** to the vet

While on a visit to my mum’s house, Teddy got into the kitchen cupboard and ate three packets of my mum’s hormone replacement therapy tablets, packet and all, that she takes for osteoporosis. We raced to the vet with a very wobbly, drunk looking dog, but the vet assured us he’d be fine, although he might bark for the next week at a higher pitch with all those female hormones in him! Nothing is safe from a Beagle.
