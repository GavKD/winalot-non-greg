###Layla has injected a new sense of life into David’s house, lifting his spirits after he lost his old dog Rufus 

After 14 years, our Golden Retriever Rufus was obviously gradually heading for the great kennel in the sky – he was stiff, slow and sleeping a lot. We got a new Golden puppy as a companion and friend, and for his last months, Layla brought a new lease of life to Rufus, and the household in general. She seemed to invigorate the old-timer and at times he was almost like a pup himself. 

> Layla brought a **new** lease of **life**

When he peacefully passed away, Layla was our comfort and consolation that life ends but also goes on, and she is now at the centre of a new generation, as our grandchildren grow up.
