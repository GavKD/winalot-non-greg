###When Claire was feeling a bit down in the dumps, she thought that a dog could make her happier. But she never expected the pure joy and calm greyhound Beaky would bring.

When I realised that I was burnt out from two years of self-employment, my Mum suggested that a dog might be a good way to help my anxiety and depression. However, my husband isn't a ‘pet person’. Once he finally relented, I searched the websites of dog rescues and eventually, Buckbeak – or Beaky as we now call him – was home with us. He quickly wove his magic on my husband with his quiet, laid back nature. I was surprised to learn that, due to his age, breed and black coat, dogs like Beaky are often overlooked and wait longer for their forever home. Their loss is most definitely our gain.

> I can **never truly thank him** for everything that he has given me. It really has been a story of us **rescuing each other**

By creating an Instagram account for Beaky, I've gained lots of useful advice. And, I feel I can be myself again with the new friends it's brought. We've also met up with other sighthounds for walks or zoomies in an enclosed field. This has allowed Beaky to socialise, which has brought him out of his shell and shown what a "cheeky Beaky" he can be.

Beaky adores his walkies. Come rain or shine his tail wags when his lead comes out. Being in nature brings us both a peaceful calm. I can never truly thank him for everything he has given me. It really has been a story of us rescuing each other.
