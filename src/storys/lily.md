###Sarah’s smile is as big as Lily’s now that she is happily settled into her new home. 

We had recently lost our beloved dog Monty when our local shelter informed us they had an eight-month-old German shepherd looking to be rehomed. We were told she was a bit of a handful having not had the best start to life. She had been at the shelter for about five months, waiting for a new family but was yet to find one due to her ‘odd’ looks. She has a prominent under bite and looks like she is growling and bearing her teeth all the time. 

> One **look** at her and we fell in **love**

One look at her and we fell in love. Her under bite doesn’t look like she’s growling to us at all — in fact, she’s constantly smiling! When we first took her home, she was very unsettled, clingy and needy, doing her best to stop us from leaving the house, constantly barking and demanding our attention, even flunking out of dog school.  But with love and perseverance, we eventually won her over and while still a bit of a character, she has become a wonderful, settled, well-behaved and loyal family dog. We certainly wouldn’t be without her beautiful grinning face!
