###Rebecca is always amused by the mischief Frankie gets up to when she’s home alone. 

> She **stole** a bag of **pasta**

We have a doggy cam to watch Frankie when we’re at work during the day, and she gets up to the weirdest things, which just go to show her personality off! Recently, she scaled her kitchen bed to save her toy Ted from the radiator where he was drying out, after she abandoned him in the garden. Another time, she stole a bag of pasta from a bag at the front door and the camera caught her dragging it outside through her doggy flap, wagging her tail every step of the way!
