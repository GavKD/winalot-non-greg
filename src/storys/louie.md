###Sophie adores how much Louie has taken her son Joseph under his wing, and now the pair are an inseparable. 

Louie is a fantastic best friend to our little boy, Joseph, who is now 13 months. He is so patient and gentle with him and makes him laugh like no one else can. Joseph loves his big brother and follows him around the house. Louie has protected Joseph since I was pregnant with him and hasn't stopped since. He is a gentle giant and we love including him on our trips away.
