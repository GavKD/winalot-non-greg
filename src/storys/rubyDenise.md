###Ruby’s eyesight and hearing are getting worse as she ages, but she still keeps Denise on her toes!

This is Ruby. She just turned 14 and is a Bearded Collie. I got Ruby when I turned 40 (hence her name) and she has been my best pal ever since. She loves cuddles and when I play on the floor with her (although we are both getting a bit too stiff for this!)

She has so many adorable habits and quirks. She loves playing with paper towels or serviettes and will shred them into tiny pieces – you'd think it had snowed in the house!

> She has so many **adorable habits and quirks**

When we take walks alongside the river, she’ll dive straight in and bark at the running water with excitement. Then she’ll get me to throw balls or stones for her while she chases them (never returning them mind you)! Again, she's getting too old to do most of this. She still loves her walks and will sleep most of the day after them, but there's no stopping her coming out.

Despite her failing eyesight and hearing, she still knows when I’m coming in the door and waddles to meet me. My Ruby means the world to me and I dread the day she is no longer by my side.
