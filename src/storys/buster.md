###Buster has a curious nature and likes to explore, but luckily Karen is always there to make sure he doesn’t get lost in wonderland! 

Buster is our gorgeous Dogs Trust rescue dog, a cross-breed of predominantly German shepherd and terrier. We adopted him when he was two years old and he was a perfect fit for our family. He is wonderful with people and other dogs and is the most laid back, affectionate and easy-going dog you could hope to find. 

> He ended up **joining** a house **party**

He loves his walks and is never happier than when he’s off his lead and sniffing around woodland, exploring amongst the trees. This inquisitive nature took a bit of time for us to get used to when we first got him. Once, he ended up joining a house party, running off at the park and letting himself into a resident’s back garden to join the fun and possibly snaffle a sausage roll! On another occasion, he disappeared down a rabbit hole in the forest — we only managed to find him because his tail was sticking out! However, he is a much more refined and well-behaved gentleman now he’s reach middle age.
