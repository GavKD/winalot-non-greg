###Ria saved Razor’s life by rescuing him from an abusive owner, and now he is happy and helping others every day. 

I rescued Razor nearly five years ago from a gang leader in South London. They were selling him for £50 on Gumtree. The advert said ‘male Rottweiler puppy for sale. If not gone tonight will be used as bait. Is useless to us as won’t fight’. I drove two hours with my uncle and rescued him. 

> **Helps** people **every** day

He was seriously underweight and had sores all over him, which we later found out was caused by someone putting cigarettes out on him. He also had trouble walking on his back legs — the gang had kept him in a cupboard. He hadn’t had much socialisation and was absolutely terrified of people and other animals. He was shaking the whole way home. 

It took over six months of hard work and training to get him to trust us. Once he did, everything was perfect! It’s been nearly five years and Razor is doing amazing. He is now a certified therapy dog and helps people every day. He even has quite a large following on his Facebook page — his followers love learning about his story and what he has been up to. Razor has come so far from the eight-week-old puppy I rescued. He has made me so proud!
