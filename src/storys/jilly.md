###Jilly might be confused about what kind of animal she is, but she’s definitely not confused about how much she loves Martha. 

Jilly is a small furry ball of energy. She is calm and affectionate at home, but the minute she is out she is very inquisitive and enjoys meeting both people and other dogs. She loves meeting bigger dogs and we think she wants to be one! 

> She does **look** a bit like a **teddy**

Once we were walking her through our village, and a child shouted at their mum ‘there’s a bear!’. When Jilly heard the shout, she stood on her back legs and started walking towards them! She does look a bit like a teddy. 

We picked her up as a puppy in August and brought her home to Cornwall. We had been looking for the right dog to accompany our daughter, Martha. She has type one diabetes, and as an only child can feel a bit alone. Jilly has been a godsend and her personality and energy has meant that Martha always has someone to stroke, who doesn’t care about her condition and will lift her spirits when she is feeling down. She has undoubtedly been the final piece of the jigsaw to our family.
