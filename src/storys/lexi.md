###Lexie’s puppy-dog eyes means that Jennifer just can’t say no.

She dug the floor up one day when she was about eight months old. I came home from work to her so pleased to see me and fetch me a toy rabbit. How could I be cross?  

> **I love her** and wouldn't want her **any other way**

Luckily, she’s never done it since. She stands up on her tiptoes when going for a walk on lead so she reminds me of a meerkat. She’s obsessed with balls and jumps like a kangaroo when you throw the ball, then doesn’t have a clue where the ball is as she bounces down the field. She begs at the table, sleeps in our bed and has taken over our lives. I love her and wouldn’t want her any other way – she’s the best. She makes me smile every day and dog walking is great for clearing head space.
