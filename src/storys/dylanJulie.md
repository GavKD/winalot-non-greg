###Whether he’s joining in on the conversation or cosying up for a cuddle, Dylan is always on his best behaviour for Julie.

Dylan is a Welsh Border Collie and his mission is to be the very best boy he can be. He lives to please, loves a cuddle, and likes to be included in every conversation – which can be a bit wearing!

When we first got him, we also had Roxy, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Dylan made it his mission to ‘round her up’ whenever he could. If she didn't behave, he would pull her to heel by her ears – the poor thing! 

> He is an **inspiration** to us all

Six years ago we moved to Devon and Dylan now loves the open countryside. Sadly, he had a whiplash injury to his back and was completely paralysed for a few months until, with a lot of help from us and the vet, he made it back onto his back legs again.

He is an inspiration to us all. He makes us laugh each day as he walks like Charlie Chaplin, and his back legs often fail to take him as far as he'd like to go. He is fiercely loyal to the family and we all love him to bits.
