###Marie made a beautiful Christmas cake for everyone to enjoy — unfortunately, Rocco had other ideas… 

On Christmas Eve several years ago, I had spent many hours creating a beautiful chocolate Yule log for the family to enjoy the following day, and I left the finished cake on the worktop. Returning to the kitchen a little later, I noticed that the Yule log had disappeared. It only took a minute before I noticed Rocco, our Golden Retriever, had a guilty expression. He’d eaten the lot, plastic decorations and all! 

> He’d **eaten** the lot

I panicked and called the vet, knowing that chocolate can be dangerous for dogs. The vet’s only suggestion was to make the dog sick — so I spent two hours driving up and down our old housing estate which was bendy, on Christmas Eve, trying to make the dog sick to no avail! The neighbours must have thought I’d lost the plot. Needless to say, the dog was fine and we coped without the Yule log!
