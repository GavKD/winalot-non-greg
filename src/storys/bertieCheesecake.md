###Bertie Cheesecake’s smile has made Karen’s life a lot sweeter. 

Bertie Cheesecake was thrown from a moving van in Cyprus and left to die. Fortunately, someone found him and brought him to a shelter where he was fostered until we adopted him and flew him to the UK to his forever sofa.  

> He brings **joy** to **everyone** who meets him

He is now an ‘ambassadog’ for Cypriot Rescue, helping to rehome other dogs through his social media. He also attends rescue shows to highlight how wonderful rescues can be, as well as visiting care homes to share his amazing smile with the residents. He brings joy to everyone who meets him, except his ninja-cat sister, who regularly gives him a paw around the head to show him who’s boss.
