###Even though it sounds cheesy, Sheldon truly has helped Jen with so much in life, always giving her a reason to smile. 

My pug has been my life since 2013. He’s got me through some horrific times, like being homeless, and suffering from paralysis due to FND. He helped me through my recovery by dragging me along. His little head tilts are the reason I get up every morning, there is no one more I can say I owe my life to. 

> He helped me through **recovery**

He loves cheese and will always do a funny head tilt when you ask him what food he loves, and when we say the magic word ‘cheese’ everyone laughs as it’s so theatrical.
