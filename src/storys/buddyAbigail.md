###He might only listen when there’s biscuits involved, but Abigail’s family wouldn’t be the same without Buddy!

Buddy is the heart of our family, and a lot more than a soft cuddly lump! Everybody loves Buddy! The grandparents always ask about him, friends always give him fuss and the neighbours always sneak him treats. You can't put your hands in your pockets without him thinking there might be a B word (biscuit) in there.

> Buddy is the **heart of our family**

Buddy was a rescue and has been with us for three years now. He fit right in! He was the support we needed after losing our beloved family dog Tyson because Buddy knows exactly when you need a cuddle. Buddy has recently claimed some new decking for himself in the garden... we now call it Buddy's decking. It even has a sign to make sure everybody knows this!

Buddy loves to come running with me. We go all over town and make people smile. His tongue is so long it hits him in the face as he runs! He's the perfect running Buddy. I'd say Buddy's super power is his selective hearing because he responds better to biscuit or dinner than his own name.
