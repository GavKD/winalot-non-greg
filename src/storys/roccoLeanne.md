###Mischievous Rocco fills Leanne’s days with joy – and her socks with holes!

Rocco is a 10-month-old Labrador who came into our lives last September when he was a couple of months old. He is a very cheeky boy and a notorious sock stealer. He loves to chew, play catch, roll around in the mud, go for long walks in the park and enjoys the occasional cuddle when he’s not causing mischief! Since Rocco came into our home we have had to repair carpets and furniture, and throw away shoes which he has chewed. He now only steals our socks, which we don’t mind as they are easily replaced.

> Who couldn’t **love** this **cheeky face**?

Although he is a very cheeky boy, he fills our hearts with joy – and our socks with holes! He is the paw-fect companion and he truly is man’s best friend (or woman’s best friend as he’s such a mummy’s boy).

He is loved so much. Who couldn’t love this cheeky face?
