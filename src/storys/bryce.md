###Tracy and Bryce share a special relationship, and are definitely on the same wavelength. 

Bryce is profoundly deaf like me. We share a very special bond and he seems to really understand me. 

> We **share** a very **special** bond

He loves nothing better than swinging on my hammock with me when the weather’s nice. In the Autumn, we go for lovely walks – even though neither of us can hear the leaves crunching, the feeling is still great. 

Bryce is very funny – he can be sound asleep, but since he can’t really hear himself, he sometimes snores so loud that he actually gives himself a fright and wakes himself up!
