###Cookie may be a bit of a diva, but with her favourite cuddly toy in tow, she’s always the perfect seaside companion for Lesley. 

Cookie likes nothing more than a stroll and sniff along the beach. She’s a rescue dog and she’s had some rubbish times, so a couple of times a year we like to take her for a lovely holiday where she can enjoy all the things that a dog should with her loved ones. 

> She’s a bit of a **diva** and **loves home comforts**

She can paddle in the sea, sniff every grain of sand and learn about new places. She’s a bit of a diva and loves home comforts so a big bed and a lovely fire to snuggle in front of is a must. But as long as her gingerbread man (her favourite toy) can come along she'll be very happy.
