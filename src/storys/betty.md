###Suzanne took Betty in from the cold, and in return her heart has been warmed by this affectionate pooch. 

Betty came to me after being surrendered by a young homeless man. I was fortunate enough to know a friend working at the organisation helping the lad, and was alerted to her plight. I had to help — having rescued animals for years, some from shelters abroad, my heart went out to the poor, traumatised and bewildered Betty,

> I feel we were **meant** to **cross paths**

We left the charity office that evening and set off for home, me going in blindly but confident we would get on fine on our week’s trial. Since that day, Betty has become a great friend and coped with the transition really well. She hasn’t had the best initial start in life but is certainly enjoying every day now, and with her cheeky personality she is winning the hearts of all who meet her (we’re still working on my two 11-year-old cats!). 

All I know is that I feel we were meant to cross paths. I was miserable without a dog and Betty desperately needed a loving home with consistent care and attention. Almost three months down the line, Betty is doing amazingly well. She’s so affectionate, cute and funny and makes me laugh and smile every day. It’s definitely not all been plain sailing, but I can honestly say that it’s all been worth it.
