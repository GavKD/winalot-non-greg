###Cody keeps his owner Sophie in stitches, making her smile with his funny habits and sunny nature.    

Cody has an ability to make anyone smile, even if they’re not dog people – he has a way of charming anyone! He encourages us to go exploring on the weekends, and since having him, we have visited more beautiful places in the UK than ever before. 

> He has us in **hysterics**

He has us in hysterics at home with his funny ways. He likes to collect all his balls and have them in a pile at bedtime, and he does cute dances, which include hi-fives, when it’s dinnertime! Cody makes you feel so positive when you’re having a bad day. The best thing you could do is to be around him for cuddles and kisses.
