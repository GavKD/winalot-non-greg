###Jenny and Lily have a great relationship, and love to spend time together, especially at the beach where Lily feels most at home. 

Lily is a seven-year-old Golden Retriever, and she is absolutely everything to me. If I’ve had a bad day, I come home and she’s waiting at the door, toy in her mouth, always pleased to see you! 

> **Always** pleased to **see** you!

She loves the beach and drags around huge pieces of seaweed, dives into the sea and rolls around on the sand! She likes to put her whole head under the water and pick things off the bottom – rocks, shells, seaweed, you name it! 

She’s just the best dog I’ve ever had and comes everywhere with me.
