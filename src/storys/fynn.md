###It’s all aboard for Claire and her sailing buddy Fynn, who has a tendency to make his co-sailors a little seasick… 

Fynn is our sailing buddy. As a Labrador, he delights in all forms of water! 

> He **splashes** through the waves  

Since he was a puppy he has come on board with us on our dinghy, and has always enjoyed every moment of it. We love his company as he splashes through the waves, trying his hardest to catch flotsam and jetsam and make other water users smile. 

His company is somewhat less enjoyable in our canoe due to his excited dashes from side to side in order to look over into the water. He is indeed a water dog through and through, and a sail would not be the same without him!
