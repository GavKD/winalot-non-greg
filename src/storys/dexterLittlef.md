###Nicola is lucky to have her two dogs Dex and Little F, who not only adore her but also love each other. 

We have two dogs, a basset named Dexter and a Pug named Little F. We rescued Little F three weeks ago, and she has slotted into our family perfectly. Her and Dex get on like they have been together for years. They cuddle up and sleep together every night. They are both so loving to us and each other. Each of them does something new every day that just melts my heart. 

> So **loving** to us and each other

Dexter is my rock as I suffer with mental health issues and severe endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome, and I spend a lot of time sick or in pain. Dex has always been there by my side no matter what. He comes and lies with me in bed when I am sick, and he sits next to me with his head on my lap.
