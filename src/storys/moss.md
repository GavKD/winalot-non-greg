###Moss loves his life as a part of owner Angharadâ€™s family, and his role as a school therapy dog. 

Moss is our family pet and a therapy dog at Wyedean School on the edge of the Forest of Dean, where he is a much-loved member of the Student Support team. 

> He loves **chasing squirrels** on our **walks**

He encourages students who find attending school very stressful to come in with jobs to do such as filling his water bowls and taking him on errands. Moss is also our family dog and, after a long day at work he loves chasing squirrels on our walks along the Afon Llwyd.
