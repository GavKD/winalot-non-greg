###Beau has provided Katrine with some structure and routine in her life when she otherwise had none – and he’s also befriended the rest of her pets! 

Having Beau makes me a responsible person. I have a job that is busy and demanding, and I had a lot of night shifts – but having him means that I have a reason to be constructive with my time off during the day. 

> I have a **reason** to be **constructive**

He is the reason that I get up early instead of staying in bed. He’s also the reason that I went through the trouble of saving up and moving into a bigger house. 

Beau is a skittish dog who doesn’t like loud noises and isn’t really that brave around strangers. We have no explanation as to why, it must just be a behavioural trait. But that doesn’t stop him from playing with the cat, defending his toys from the ferrets who love to steal them or even trying to play with the pygmy hedgehogs! He knows that they’re spikey but he still has to investigate. 

He’s my baby, and I don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t have him heavy sighing at me when he’s not been walked!
