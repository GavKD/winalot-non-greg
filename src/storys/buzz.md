###Buzz Lightyear has majorly improved Larissa’s quality of life, and she loves him to infinity and beyond. 

I adopted Buzz Lightyear when he was a puppy. He has become an amazing therapy dog, who has helped improve my mental health. He has helped me with living on my own independently, and I couldn’t go a day without him by my side.  

> He has **improved** my life **drastically**

He loves a good run around, and if you throw a ball that’s his favourite thing to do. He loves the outside, and although it’s difficult for me to sometimes get about because of my MS, he relaxes my state of mind with that smile on his face. 

He has improved my life drastically and I love him so much. I can live independently and do as I wish, as I know I have him to help me along the way. He is the best dog, always friendly, energetic, full of personality and there to cheer me up when I am not in a good place. I couldn’t wish for a better companion, I adore him. Whoever you are Buzz will always greet you with a smile — he is just one happy, loving dog.
