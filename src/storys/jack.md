###Ben has his hands full with Jack and his feline friends, but he wouldn’t change it for the world. 

We met Jack at an RSPCA centre, he was six years old and had a story. Mainly the guy at the centre said he didn’t know what a toy was, and he had spent weeks trying to teach him about toys and playing. We had all our checks and brought him home, he immediately took to my wife and rarely leaves her side. 

He has had lots of toys since, he doesn’t always play well and likes chasing after balls but stubbornly refusing to bring them back. He has made friends with our two cats, and has cuddles with his cat buddy Milo. Both can often be found on a bed they are not supposed to be on! 

> Despite his **age**, he can be **naughty**

Jack loves walks, but a lot slower now due to his age. His nose is still going strong and he sniffs everything on his walks. Despite his age, he can be naughty. The latest events include stealing a sausage from the oven and also a naan bread from his mum’s plate. He’s surprisingly fast for his age when food is involved. Most of all, we love him.
