###Molly has turned Joanna into a total canine convert, and now the pair are inseparable. 

My partner and I had been talking about getting a dog for a while, as I now work from home and so would be able to look after a pup. I actually used to be quite scared of dogs growing up – I’ve always been a cat person! But as soon as I saw Molly’s photo on the Dogs Trust website, I instantly fell in love.

We’ve only had her for a little while but I am now a total dog mum and love her so much. She’s such a sweet, good-natured puppy, who loves to snuggle on the sofa and play with her toys. 

Working from home and running a business alone is a tad scary, but Molly now gets me up in the morning with a spring in my step. She’s definitely been a good influence – taking her out on walks every day means that I have to put on real clothes, rather than just sitting in my dressing gown all day!
