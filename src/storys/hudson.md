###Hudson is a real character with lots of funny quirks, but that’s exactly why Jade loves him so much. 

Hudson is the joy of mine and my partners’ lives. He is a rescue street dog from Romania and a cross between a Border Collie and a Labrador. His personality just shines and astounds us every single day, especially when it comes to food. He is honestly the most food-orientated dog ever, he would do anything for a little bit of cheese or chicken! 

He has many quirks that seem to get weirder and weirder, but of course make him cuter every day. He barks and runs in his sleep, and even dribbles so much that it drops onto the floor just before being given his night-time biscuit. 

> His intelligence **astounds** me

His intelligence astounds me, we have bought him numerous puzzles for dogs where you hide treats on all levels, and he has figured out every single one of them within three minutes or under! 

He loves his naps and gets super grumpy when woken, which is just so adorable. I wouldn’t consider getting another dog that wasn’t a rescue, these dogs have so much love to give and you can tell how much he appreciates us on a daily basis. Rescuing a dog is amazing and so rewarding, I am so glad to have my Hudson!
