###Lucia’s dogs Darcy and Tessa make the perfect pair, always running around together and providing each other and Lucia with joy and companionship. 

> Best of **friends**

We have two beautiful nine month old puppies, Darcy is a Golden Labrador and Tessa is a Golden Retriever.  They have been the best of friends since we brought them both home on the same day in July last year.  Constantly play fighting, cuddling, running together with one stick between them, they keep us busy but also keep us very happy.
