###Jasper is much happier now that he has moved into his forever home with Elizabeth, and he has brought a new lease of life into the family.  

Lottie came to us via a rescue centre in Nottingham. She was originally a street dog in Romania, and once over here she was on a foster farm for a few weeks. We will have had Lottie five years in February 2020.

> He now loves **his** new **home**

We rescued Jasper around ten years ago. He was running away from his previous owners and they had had enough. He was due to be put to sleep, but we saved him with two days to spare. He now loves his new home with me and my mum. 

He loves a country walk with me, then is favourite part is getting home with his favourite toy and cuddling with my mum. During the day when Iâ€™m not at work, he spends the time with my mum. My mum has Multiple Sclerosis so is unable to walk, Jasper keeps her company and mobile and really lifts her spirits.
