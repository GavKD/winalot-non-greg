###Deb didn’t plan to adopt Scruffy, but she instantly fell in love with this adorable fluffball who has provided endless love and support ever since! 

Scruffy is the most calm, patient and loving dog you could ever wish to meet. We rescued him after his first birthday on January 12th, 2011. 

His first owner passed away when he was eight months old. The owners’ daughter tried him in 10 homes before we got him five months later. He was left with a neighbour who brought him to the vet to be put to sleep, as he was in such a bad way that he had worms coming out through his skin. My friend, who was at the vet with her own dog from the rescue at the time, stepped in when overhearing the plan to put Scruffy down and said she would get the rescue to take him in. 

> He is our **angel**

We initially fostered Scruffy from the rescue, but within two weeks we adopted him. He is so gentle, so passive and calm with other dogs. He is our angel after our grown-up boys left home. He has helped me through a nervous breakdown and a chronic lifetime illness. 

He plays sheriff to our cats when they’re naughty but is very protective of them when out on his walks if they follow us. He loves playing hide and seek with us and is also good at finding the ball if we hide it. He is very obedient and loves to play with other dogs. He also reacts to hand commands rather than speech and learns very quickly!
