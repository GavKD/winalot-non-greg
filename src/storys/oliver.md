###With plenty of walkies and cuddles to enjoy, Oliver has given Hannahâ€™s grandparents a new lease of life.

We rescued Oliver after my grandparents lost both of their teenage dogs within a month of each other. My nan became very lonely and missed having some doggies to love. She is such a nurturing person and she had no little four-legged friend to dote on. And my Gramps stopped going out because he had no dogs to walk. I couldn't quite believe how much they deteriorated after losing their dogs. Life just wasn't the same for them.

> The **joy** that came back into that house was just **immeasurable**

Then we got Oliver and took him to my grandparents. My nan instantly fell in love with him. My Gramps cried and I'd only ever seen him cry once before. The joy that came back into that house was just immeasurable. He's a very clingy dog and, 18 months on, he can't be without my grandparents. My Gramps goes for a walk with Oliver every day and his and overall fitness has improved dramatically. I live next door to them and so every time my Gramps takes him for a walk, Oliver insists on coming to my window to say hello. He is the most loving and loved dog.
