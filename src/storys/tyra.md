###When Karen entered a new relationship, she never realised that would require her to be a dog co-parent, but now her life revolves around Tyra, and she wouldn’t have it any other way. 

Tyra, a Parsons Jack Russell, came into my life six years ago when I fell in love with her owner. When we all moved in together I allowed her to do things previously not in the house rules.

> Holidays **revolve** around **her**

Now my little pooch is allowed on couch, sleeps beside someone every night and holidays revolve around her. Tyra is a huge fan of motor home holidays exploring beautiful beaches all over Scotland. She also loves camping holidays even in the snow. She's becoming an old lady but you would never know! She still runs around and has boundless energy just as if she were still a pup. The kids have taught her tricks and now to get a treat she will go through the whole routine without being prompted which is so cute.
