###Amanda’s dogs have helped her stay active and provide unrivalled companionship.

I have a disability which affects my feet and back and I struggle to walk far, but since Ron and Reggie came into my life I have become stronger. It’s not easy, but taking them out for walks twice a day has helped me to get out more and even make new friends. 

> They are very **gentle** and **caring**, and do everything **together**

Ron and Reggie’s personalities are very sweet: they love children and playing with other dogs. And they are very cheeky if they think you have a treat for them!

They are very gentle and caring, and do everything together. They especially love going for a swim in the lake near where I live. 

My favourite thing about Ron and Reggie is that they cuddle up to me all night long. They really are the best dogs ever and have made my life so much better.
