###Amanda’s dogs have helped her stay active and provide unrivalled companionship.

Teddy likes to keep Angela on her toes with his love of mischief.

> Teddy has **two** speeds – **'hurtle'** and **'sleep'**

We went to pick Teddy up from a litter of ‘oops’ puppies on a farm. When we first saw him, he was black and yellow – the farmer said he had turned his back for a second and Ted had decided to explore the sheep trough! 

Teddy has two speeds – ‘hurtle’ and ‘sleep’. He loves long walks and hurtles through the countryside, as well as splashing around at the seaside. Most of all, he loves his very own humans (and especially enjoys stealing their socks!).
