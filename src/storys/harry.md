###Harry the Hungarian stray’s love for life makes him Audrey’s hero. 

Harry has had a hard life. After rescuing him in Hungary as a stray, we adopted him as a companion for our other dog Orla.

> **Brave little Harry** shows us every day just how to fight **adversity**

We gradually brushed out Harry’s matted coat and slowly his fears started to fade. But sadly, six months after we adopted him he suddenly became blind. We were so sad for this poor little dog who had just started to love life. But brave little Harry shows us every day just how to fight adversity. 

His amazing attitude makes us smile as he continues to live his new life to the full. He turns every obstacle into an opportunity, like cocking his leg on anything he bumps into. You just have to laugh! Harry has taught us so much. He’s a truly special dog!
