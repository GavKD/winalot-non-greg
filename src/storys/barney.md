###Barney loves having a dip in the water and he’s certainly making a splash at Deneen’s home, too.

Barney AKA Barney Boo is a working Cocker Spaniel. He’s got a beautiful temperament, he’s full of character and he’s a very handsome dog. Plus, he absolutely loves the water, so much so we think he's semi aquatic! 

> We honestly can't believe how much he has **transformed** our **lives**

Barney is our first dog – we picked him up at nine weeks old and we honestly can't believe how much he has transformed our lives. We love everything about him. He is loyal and always happy to see us, although he's a little bit spoilt too! He loves the beach, the woods and exploring, and even sulks when we have to come home from holidays.
