###Even though Spike had been in the kennels for a while, Kate always knew that there was something special about him – and now he is an integral member of the family. 

When you lose your dog after 15 years, you think you could never love another the same. I thought this until I chose Spike from a rescue center 18 months ago. 

Spike is a cross breed and had been overlooked in the kennels for six months. He didn’t fit a breed description but had the nicest nature, and there was just something about him. I visited him several times, thought long and hard and finally I brought him home! 

> Spike also **loves** my **granddaughter**

He adores people and he loves a visit to my old very ill father. He also loves to ride in the car, rolling around on his carpet and eating cream crackers – he even knows where they’re kept! Spike also loves my granddaughter, and when she visits, her face lights up when she spots him. They are the best of friends.

When we first got him, his tail never wagged,  and now it never stops!  I can’t believe he’s not broken it! He’s not had much in life, I’m pretty sure of that, but he loves life now. He’s such a character, funny and even likes cats! I like to think of him as my old dogs legacy and cannot imagine being without him.

Ps – people always comment on his ears!
