###It’s easy to catch Toby’s attention with a crumb of cheese. But Ryan knows he’ll always find his way back home.

Toby is quite a unique character indeed. As a Border Collie crossed with a Dalmatian, he has a beautiful coat and features. Whenever he goes for a walk people just have to stop and say hello to him - he has such a friendly nature. He brings so much love into our home! He loves coming on adventures with us. Our last big adventure with him was a camping holiday along the North Coast 500 – he absolutely loved it, especially the beaches where he could run free! It makes us happy to see him happy.

> He brings **so much love** into our **home**

He's loved by all of our neighbours too. He'll disappear from the garden sometimes and after a short but frantic search we'll find him in one of our neighbour's houses being fed cheese. He absolutely loves cheese (in small doses, of course!).

He's obsessed by shadows and reflections too. He'll stare at a wall for hours if there is a reflection. This makes it very difficult to take a good photo of him, because as soon as you pull your phone out he starts chasing the reflection. It's great fun to watch.
