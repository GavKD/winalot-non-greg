###Bosley loves showering people with kisses – especially his owner Jenny!

Bosley is super special. He was born blind and he’s been with us since he was 10 weeks old. He brings so much joy into our lives.

He plays ball every day. We go to a quiet green and he listens for the ball, runs after it and brings it back to me. He would literally do this all day if he could. He has a blog on his Facebook page, where he discusses his daily life with the world!

> There’s something about him that makes **everyone love him**

Last year he was invited to a Bedlington Fun Dog show, where they made him a kissing booth. So many people came along for a kiss. They paid a £1.00 per kiss and he made £280 for the Mila Bedlington Charity, which helps raise money for any Bedlington Terrier in need.

He’s such a lovely, friendly soul, I’d be lost without him by my side. There’s something about him that makes everyone love him.
