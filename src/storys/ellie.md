###Ellie completes Margaret’s family, and she is always there for them like they are for her. 

Ellie has been with us since she was nine weeks old. She was an RSPCA rescue dog. She is a Staffie Cross, the smallest of five puppies who we fell in love with on first seeing. She isn’t a pet to us, she is our family member. 

> She is our **family** member

She has helped me personally through many difficult times — on bad days after losing my precious dad, and when I was diagnosed with breast cancer she never left my side from start to finish of my treatment. She understands our every thought and makes us laugh every day. We always say that she doesn’t think she is a dog! 

She has many medical problems herself to overcome but we have always been there for her, like she has us. Life would just not be the same without her.
