###We all need somebody to lean on. So when things got tough for Emma, Ollie proved to be a faithful four-legged companion.

Ollie came into my life when he was three. I rescued him from a breeder that over-used him as a stud.

I suffer from long term anxiety and PTSD. I feel he rescued me or maybe we rescued each other. We now both are inseparable and I want to make sure he gets to enjoy his new life to the full.

> I feel he **rescued me** or maybe we **rescued each other**

He is so playful and barks when he's not the centre of attention. As a typical lab, he loves his food. Heâ€™s my best friend and we have a lot of fun together. He's a real cheeky chappy, full of love and cuddles.
