###Kirsty didn’t anticipate how much work it would be to take care of Buster – but more importantly, she could never have dreamed of the positive influence he would bring into her life. 

We got Buster from a breeder when he was just nine months old. The breeder didn’t warn us of how nervous Buster gets around new dogs and new situations. Being the first time I have looked after a dog on my own this was quite overwhelming but I didn’t want to give up on Buster as he has such a kind heart and so much love to give. He just needed the right guidance in certain situatio

Since we adopted Buster we have worked so hard with him and a trainer to start to get him more confident in these situations. I expected to work hard and I expected there to be highs and lows – but what I never expected was how much I would learn from Buster. 

> Has taught me **patience** and **perseverance**

Buster has taught me patience and perseverance in his training. He has taught me to accept flaws and love unconditionally. Most importantly, he has taught me to take everything one step at a time and to be happy and celebrate the small accomplishments.

Busters favourite thing to do is to play fetch and train with his toys. He is very toy-motivated and will do pretty much anything for a tennis ball! When he’s is at home, he spends his days sitting at the window watching the squirrels or on his back snoozing on the sofa. He absolutely loves human attention and is a sucker for a belly rub! 

Buster really is a special dog. He was much more than I bargained for and requires lots of work, but I don’t think I could imagine a world without him anymore. We tackle problems together, and it’s so rewarding watching him overcome his fears.
