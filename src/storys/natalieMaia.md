###Maia is Natalie’s first dog, and she has fulfilled all her expectations and more with her loving nature and ability to spread joy wherever she goes. 

Maia is an angel, she has done nothing but bring us happiness and love. I’ve never had a dog before, and the only thing missing from our family was her.

She adores my niece and nephew and would protect them with her life. She loves cuddles and always comes and thanks us after she has her food, climbing onto the settee rubbing her head in our hands! In the summer she enjoys going outside to chase bumble bees and to check on our rabbits.

> She has done nothing but bring us **happiness** and **love**

We have a special bed in our bedroom for her, so she always feels safe and loved. She loves laying upside down showing us her big cheesy grin! Her favourite thing to do is to play with a big football and going to fields so we can kick it over and over again. 

Maia pulls the sweetest face when we drop her off at the in-laws when we go to work – she jumps at the window and watches us leave. I’ve never known the love of a dog, but now I can’t imagine it any other way. She’s the craziest, happiest and most loyal dog I could have ever imagined. Dogs truly are angels, just without the wings. They are the only thing in this world that loves you more than they love themselves.
