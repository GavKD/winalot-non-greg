###Katy’s job means that she often has to work far away from friends and family – Womble is always there to lift her spirits and keep her company. 

I am a serving Officer in the British Army. I have grown up with dogs and absolutely adore them, but due to being in the military and often being deployed overseas, it wasn’t possible to adopt one for some time. 

Finally, in June last year I moved into a job where I won’t deploy and I worked in a place that was very pet friendly, so I could even bring a dog into work with me. So, I started looking around and I found Womble, a gorgeous, scruffy, mixed breed rescue dog from Serbia. 

> Become an **inseparable** duo

As soon as he arrived he was so impressive with his adaptability and took everything in his stride! He wasn’t too sure about being indoors, didn’t like the slippy kitchen floor and was scared of heights so wouldn’t go upstairs. However, it didn’t take long for him to decide that being indoors on the sofa was his favourite place, the kitchen was where he could hoover up dropped food and if he went upstairs he could sleep in the bed! 

I am currently posted to a location five hours away from my friends, family and partner, so Womble and I have fast become an inseparable duo – running, hiking, exploring, going for picnics and watching films on the sofa! He has made my life so colourful and stops me from getting lonely. Together, we are a perfect team!
