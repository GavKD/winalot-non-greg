###Life will never be the same for Hetty and her husband now that Teal has joined their family.

Teal is an English springer spaniel. As he ages, his ailments have gotten worse, such as his hip dysplasia. So, we are now experts in dog physiotherapy and our vet is very well-known at hydrotherapy.

> It was Teal that **helped him** through those six months

My husband was not a keen dog lover at first, but now would not be without a dog. When I was working and my husband was off from work, it was Teal that helped him through those six months. Teal has had such a calming effect on us both.

We are now so much fitter due to all the walking, too. And every morning he comes into our bedroom for an ear scratch or a bum scratch without fail. Thatâ€™s our Teal.
