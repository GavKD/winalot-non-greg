###Louise has brought a lot of joy into Lyndaâ€™s life, even if she does have a mischievous side! 

Louise is a Greek Jura hound who I rescued from Larnaca in Cyprus. She was found by a great charity out there called Second Chance Dogs. She joined our family in 2016 and became good friends with her sister Jasmine, who we also rescued from Cyprus. 

> Loving **and** loyal

Louise is full of life and mischief. We call her the magpie because she steals everything and hides it in the garden! She is very loving and loyal despite her previous background. She is like my best friend and both her and Jasmine give me great contentment, especially after losing my last dog Dylan so suddenly. They are loyal companions who are loved dearly by all the family.
