###Attentive, caring and oh-so gentle, Kiwi seems to sense when Emma’s daughter is about to have a seizure.

Kiwi was a present for our daughter who we nearly lost last year. My daughter fell in love with Kiwi the moment she met her and Kiwi went straight to Abbie. We didn’t know she was the last puppy left.

> The **bond** these two have is the **sweetest**

At 4 ½ months old, Kiwi started to bark and pull at our daughter’s feet and she then started having a seizure. From then on, Kiwi helped Abbie come out of her seizures by licking her face and barking before she has one. She will stay with her until she comes around. She’s doesn’t do it every time but 90% of the time she does. At only 10 months old, it’s amazing.

The bond these two have is the sweetest. It truly melts my heart each day. Abbie has not been in school since Christmas because of her seizures and now they’re inseparable.
