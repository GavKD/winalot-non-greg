###With his mischievous personality and loving cuddles, Boo-Boos has been a real rock for Michelle, even when things were tough.

Ten years ago, my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He had to quit his job and stop driving, which left him feeling quite isolated. Then we got the opportunity to get a dog. This dog was Boo-Boos – and he changed my family’s life. Dad and I took Boo-Boos out for walks and it gave him some purpose, even on days when he wasn't feeling great.

> Without him I have **no idea** what I would have done. He’s my **best friend**

Dad passed away ten months after getting Boo-Boos and I felt like my life had stopped. But Boo-Boos made me get up in the mornings and showed me unconditional love. I've suffered from bouts of depression but Boo-Boos has always been there to make me smile.

Without him, I have no idea what I would have done. He’s my best friend. He’s a naughty, mischievous Jack Russell who loves to bark in the window but he loves cuddles. He hates loud noises but pretends that he's the toughest dog.
