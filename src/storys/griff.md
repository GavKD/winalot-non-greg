###Rory and Griff are raising a baby and even rescuing people together, but it’s just Griff who’s stealing sausages from the butchers… 

Griff joined us from a rescue shelter in Wales. He is a border collie and had been found as a stray. He settled in quickly before we suddenly found out we were expecting our first baby. 

> It’s **obvious** that Griff **loves** his job

Once I tied Griff outside the baker’s in the village to go and buy a loaf of bread. I looked through the window only to see half of Griff’s lead swaying in the wind. It was frayed at one end with no dog attached, chewed through in a matter of seconds! A moment later and a commotion came from the butcher’s shop next door, as Griff was chased out by a very angry butcher shouting and wielding his meat cleaver. Apparently, Griff had gone straight into the back of the shop to investigate the sausages. I don’t leave him tied up near there anymore. 

As well as helping us raise Maia, Griff and I have also trained together to become a mountain rescue dog search team. We are still trainees, but hoping to graduate next year. As well as learning to search for people, we also have to train a high level of obedience, agility and perfect control around livestock, and we train a couple of times each week. It’s obvious that Griff loves his job and I have to admit that I love the privilege of being able to work alongside him.
