###Abigail and Rufus are an inseparable duo – he even comes with her to university, where he is the most popular student among both the teachers and the pupils!  

Rufus is an ESA for me and so he comes everywhere I go. This includes to the university with me, which makes him pretty popular (and pretty smart). He is officially the youngest attendee of the University of Sheffield, as he first attended at just 13 weeks old! 

> He comes **everywhere** I go

Ru (he has a weak left leg so we call him Ru, like a kangaroo because he sometimes hops), is the kindest dog. He loves all humans and does his best booty wiggle when he greets them! 

Rufus helps with my mental health and I can’t imagine a more positive influence.
