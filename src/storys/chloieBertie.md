###I’d had family dogs while growing up, but my black lab Bertie is the first one I’ve been able to call my own. He was only eight weeks old when I first got him in December 2017, but he certainly wasn’t just for Christmas! Over nearly two years he’s become such a lovely companion to me.

I love how our friendship has evolved, for instance he’s really developed a love for being the centre of attention – he just gets cheekier and cheekier! He’s so kind-natured to go with that though, and he not only cheers me up but he brings a smile and laugh to everyone he sees. If he’s feeling super-generous, he might even leap up and try and give you a kiss. 

> He just gets **cheekier** and **cheekier**

Bertie, or Bertie Basset as I often call him, clearly comes from a very special family, because three of his brothers and sisters have gone on to become trained assistance dogs for Purina’s charity partner Canine Partners. I feel so lucky to have him, especially when he shows me his big brown eyes – definitely his best feature. He definitely knows how to get in my good books!
