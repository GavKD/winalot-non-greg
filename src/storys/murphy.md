###Kelly finds Murphy’s joy in living life to the full invigorating, and he has inspired her to get out and moving. 

Murphy is such a sheer joy to be around, his constant energy and thirst for life is infectious. Whether it’s hiking up mountains, trips to the beach, strolls through the wood or hitting the cities to shop we have done it all together. I love that he is always ready and rearing to go no matter what. 

Since having him, I have found a love for new hobbies like hiking and paddle boarding and have explored so much more of the UK with him by my side. I've also met so many new friends because of him. 


> Always **ready** and **rearing** to go

Murphy is a typical spaniel and only has one speed – 100mph! He enjoys nothing more than being free to run, feeling that breeze through his impressive tabs! It’s hard not to instantly fall in love with him. He has the waggiest tail you'll ever see and greets everyone with a complete body shake, rolling over for that belly tickle. A good ear scratch will have him grunting in delight and he's not afraid to give you a kiss in public. Murphy really is the best friend I could ever have imagined, and I am the luckiest girl in the world to have found him when I did!
