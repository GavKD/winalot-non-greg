###Naomi loves Benji for all of his quirks, and could never get tired of his happy-go-lucky personality and charming nature.  

Benji is a real character! He’s grown up on a dairy farm but doesn’t quite have the Collie instinct and is very much a family pet rather than a working dog. When we got him, I was recovering from severe mental health problems and having a little pup to look after really helped me through. 

When Benji was two he had a traumatic fall, resulting in serious injuries but thankfully he pulled through and charmed all the vet nurses during his stay. 

> So **in tune** with human **emotions**

True to his Collie nature, he loves fetching anything you throw for him! He would happily spend hours collecting a ball for you and would never admit how tired he is. Although he’s ‘technically’ an outside dog, he loves nothing more than a snuggle in the utility every evening after his tea. 

I have never met a dog so in tune with human emotions. If I’m having a bad day, he will snuggle in and make sure I’m ok. If I’m panicking, he nudges me and tries to get me out of it, if I’m happy then he’s happy. 

He has so many quirks and habits there are just too many to mention, but I can honestly say that seeing his little face every morning makes my life so much happier.
