###Lucy feels so lucky that she has been able to give Ida her forever home, and watch her turn from a sad rescue into a bundle of joy. 

Ida is a Romanian dog. I saw a photo of her on a friend’s Facebook page — she was fostering Ida but her dog didn’t like her and she was desperate to find a new home for her. I fell for her immediately. Ida had been rescued from one of the Romanian ‘kill’ shelters, where she had been found with her litter of dead puppies. 

> The most **joyful, loving** and **delightful** dog

She was little more than a pup herself but despite everything she’s been through, she is the most joyful, loving and delightful dog you can imagine. She adores walks, games and cuddles and has brought such happiness to our lives. I’m so grateful that she came to us.
