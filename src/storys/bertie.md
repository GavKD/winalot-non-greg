###While some dogs like to play fetch or run around outside, Rebecca’s dog Bertie loves nothing more than sitting and watching other animals.  

> Bertie absolutely loved sitting and watching

Bertie has always loved to just watch animals. He doesn’t bark or try and hurt them, he just loves to watch them. For his first birthday, we took him to the beach at Skegness, and found that there was a seal sanctuary that allows well-behaved dogs. There are meerkats and penguins as well, and Bertie absolutely loved sitting and watching the animals. People couldn’t believe he wasn’t barking, just watching. If he sees ducks or any other animals he will just happily watch them for hours.
