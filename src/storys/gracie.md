###No matter how stressful Janeâ€™s day has been, Gracie is always there to give her a hug.

Gracie is a retired greyhound from the Brighton greyhound trust. When I went to look at the dogs they were all so beautiful, but she came right over and stood up to say hi. She gets a lot of attention when we are out due to her striking tiger stripes. 

> Gracie is the **perfect** friend  

Gracie has made our lives such fun. She is a gentle friend and great to have around. When I come in stressed from work, she is there to greet me with her sweet paws and wiggles. The thing I love about her the most is her elegance and peacefulness. I am a teacher and so my job is often demanding when I come home. Gracie is the perfect friend, always there for a cuddle and a sofa snuggle. 

Greyhounds are just lovely, she loves to run free with my husband on the downs, and she loves the snow and the countryside. When I get ready for work, she jumps and skips excitedly around. She is the best tonic.
