###Pamela’s dad used to have a ‘no pets’ rule. But when you find a dog as adorable as Oscar, rules are meant to be broken.

My dad always said: ‘No pets!’, then when I left for university six years ago, my mum posted a picture of my brother and a dog in the family group chat – and surprise! We had a sudden new addition to the family, our Bichon Frise, Oscar. A best friend for my autistic brother, another child for my mum and dad, and a stress-relieving friend for me when I had exams.

> He brings **so much joy** to our busy, stressful lives

He loves to play with his food before eating it. He loves to climb on top of you when you're sat on the sofa so he can poke his head out of the front window and guard the house. An empty milk bottle is his favourite toy. We love him so much and he brings so much joy to our busy, stressful lives.
