###Bringing joy to even the most mundane tasks, Keira helps Louise appreciate the little things in life.

Keira is a beautiful white German Shepherd crossed with a Labrador. I’ve had dogs all my life. They always bring you joy and love when you need it most, but Keira goes above and beyond. We only got her in May, but since the very first day we saw her, I knew I couldn’t be without her. She had a rough start in life – she was put into a pound in Ireland, which meant she was sadly at risk of being put to sleep. Fortunately, a lovely animal sanctuary stepped in and saved her.

She was petrified of anything and everything. Even a lead, which should be a joy, was a source of fear. We dread to think how she was living before.

> Keira goes **above and beyond**

However, she is now my best friend. She brings a purpose to my daily life, giving me a reason to go for long walks and appreciate being outdoors. Working on tricks is something we love to do, and it certainly tires us both out. She’s always full of beans, constantly on the go. There’s never a dull moment. She makes you smile even when you don’t want to.

Because of her, I’ve found something I love to do. Dog training is something I have a new appreciation for, and I love learning about her behaviour and how to train dogs.

Seeing the joy that she sees in the world, is something to be inspired by. We should all try to look at the world through a dog’s eyes. They always show love no matter what.
