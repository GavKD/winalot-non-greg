###Joss is the perfect Collie for Christine and her family, who have all loved watching him regain his confidence.  

Thirteen years ago, we went on the search for a rescue Collie on the RSPCA Lancashire website.  When we got there, the particular Collie we saw had been reserved, but they suggested our Joss. He had been a stray, so no history, a very handsome boy. We chose him. 

> His main hobby was **stealing** socks

We struggled to get him in the car, he was obviously petrified. Eventually we got him home and realised we had a totally un-socialised dog that was scared of his own shadow. Over the next few months we tried really hard by taking him to agility classes and socialising him with people and other dogs. His main hobby was stealing socks and eating them whole, eventually regurgitating them a couple of weeks later. We thought he wanted his stomach to feel full. He sometimes hid in dark places such as the deep recesses of the garage or wardrobes. We realised he had most probably been locked up for most of his early life. 

My heart sang as I saw him run off lead for the first time. Eventually he became a calming influence on reactive dogs. His body language has become amazing. He is now about 17 years old and enjoys sleeping at the bottom of our bed between our legs. He still has the odd issue, but is fit and happy. We love our boy.
