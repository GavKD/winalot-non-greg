###From nervous rescue to confident canine, David has watched Rosy flourish since being under his care.  

After losing a dog to cancer, we had a dog-shaped hole in our lives. Our vet put us in touch with a charity that rescues dogs from Serbia. They had recently received a young female, about six months old, that needed to be rehomed.

She was a bit nervous and didn’t make any noise on arriving, but three years on she is more confident around people, very obedient and loves other dogs. We wouldn’t change her for any other dog in the world!
