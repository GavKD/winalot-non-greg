###Whether she’s practising yoga or befriending dogs in the park, Coco has changed Kate’s life for the better.

Coco is a joy! She always wants to be in on the action. She simply adores other people and other dogs too.

Even during the lockdown, Coco can’t help but bring us many laughs. While attempting my first lockdown home yoga, Coco was instantly on my mat (maybe she wanted to try the downward dog pose)!

> **Life** would simply **not be the same** without Coco

Despite having major leg surgery at 18 months old, Coco lives life to the full. She enjoys energetic walks and often sniffs out other dogs treats – much to our embarrassment.

Life would simply not be the same without Coco.
