###Grace already had a lot of pets, but the arrival of Tilley into her life has given her a new best friend. She’s loved watching her grow from a timid rescue into a happy pup.

In 2014, our pup Tilley was found abandoned in a box in Lesvos, being the only one out of her siblings to survive the winter months on nothing but the scraps that she found. She was in a terrible state, but thanks to her incredible rescuers her life was saved!

Tilley remained in foster care for a year with rescuers, but was eventually put up for adoption. Then she flew all the way to the UK, to be adopted by a family for two years. After that, they no longer wanted her and so she returned to the charity. We noticed her profile and absolutely fell in love.

> **Incredible** to see her **confidence** bloom

Tilley arrived at her forever home on 29th July 2018 and has had the most amazing impact on our lives! She loves her sister Kiki, the three legged cheeky cat from Battersea and is ever so kind to her. Of course, we can’t forget Tiny and Maggie, the hamsters who Tilley loves to watch when they spin in their wheels!

It has been incredible to see her confidence bloom and her cheeky character shine through. When we first brought her home she was terrified of going upstairs - she uses to shake and have her tail in between her legs, but now she sprints up to my bed when she’s had enough of our voices! She also didn’t like staying out in the garden, and now she sunbathes for hours with her sister Kiki.

I’m so grateful to have such an incredible pup and best friend in my life!
