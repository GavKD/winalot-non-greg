###Naomi and her family are very grateful for Monty, who came into their lives when they were feeling low, as he quickly boosted their spirits. 

Monty came into our lives when we were all suffering from a traumatic event. He helped us all with our mental health and we are now working so much better as a family unit. 

> He **helped** us **all** 

He is still very young, but already has his quirks – he loves his bed, tummy rubs and pulling clean laundry off the stairs when the children haven’t put it away yet. I think this is his way of telling them to hurry up and do so!
