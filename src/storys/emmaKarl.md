###Emma loves to take Karl with her everywhere she goes, but she can’t take her eye off him, not even for a minute… 

Since getting him as a puppy, Karl has always gone everywhere with me as my best friend – whether it’s the pub, woods, beach, train or coffee shop. While on holiday, we decided to pop into a coffee shop for lunch (after a nice stroll along the beach), taking advantage of a tired puppy. We made our order and started chatting to some friends we saw in the corner. It was a small shop and was very busy, but Karl seemed pretty happy just under the table – or so we thought. About 10 minutes must have gone by, and when our order came we glanced under the table to see that he had been occupied with my mum’s good handbag! 

> Karl has **always** gone **everywhere** with me

Safe to say she was a bit upset, but nobody could stay angry at those adorable puppy dog eyes, and everyone in the shop started laughing at the chewed-up handbag. He was one smug little beagle afterwards!
