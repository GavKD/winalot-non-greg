###When things get a bit overwhelming for Michelle, Luna knows exactly how to brighten up her day.

Luna is a very bouncy, barking-mad bundle of joy. I suffer from anxiety quite badly. Luna is my support and my comfort. She makes me smile with her antics, and having her around makes me go outside. When I walk with Luna, it relaxes me, improves my mood and my health. When she senses I'm upset – or even if I cough or stub my toe – she comes running, jumps up to me and licks my face to make sure I'm okay.

> When I look at Luna, I feel **so much love** and happiness, my **heart is full**

She is a very quirky dog, as most Doodles are. She likes to sleep upside down a lot, she dashes around the house and jumps from sofa to sofa in wild excitement. She barks at animals on the telly even when they are cartoon ones. She will often bounce down the road on her back legs like a kangaroo, she wants to say hello to everyone and everything. She is incredibly nosy and watch people if they are painting their fence or gardening. She is loyal and loving. When I look at Luna, I feel so much love and happiness, my heart is full.
