###I can’t believe it’s only been two years since I was paired with gorgeous assistance dog Flora, thanks to Canine Partners. I live with a condition called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome – a connective tissue disorder which among other things means I can dislocate any joint at random.

It’s not just the physical things Flora can do for me that make me love her – and she can do a lot, including pick me up off the floor if I fall and even take my boots off. It’s stuff like when I have a down day, when I’m in pain or feeling blue, she'll do something stupid like chuck one of my socks around to make me laugh. They kind of have this sixth sense when you need cheering up. She is, after all, a dog, and she has those days where she can’t be bothered, and if I ask her to do something she just goes and pushes the alarm that alerts my mum!

As soon as I took Flora home, my parents were able to have their first holiday in ages without worrying about me. She can get the phone and all sorts – it’s almost like they trust her more than me! I’ve now been able to start an open degree in creative arts, and I’ve also started a not-for-profit where I teach disabled people how to alter their own clothing. Flora and I matched because we’re both a bit quirky, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
