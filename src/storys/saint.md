###Saint is Ian’s saviour, and he loves spreading the happiness around.

My favourite thing about Saint is that he is always happy. He has a very outgoing personality, he just wants to be friends with everyone! 

> He just **wants** to be friends with **everyone!**

He’s terrified of cats though – he met my cat when he was only eight weeks old, and the cat hissed at him. He ran away crying and refuses to go anywhere near cats now! 

He is trained as my emotional support animal, which allows me to lead a relatively normal life. As long as he is with me, I feel in control. This means we can do lots together, and one of our favourite things to do is visit different food festivals.
