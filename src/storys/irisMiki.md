###Iris has always done her best by Miki, even when times were tough – and Miki has always been there for Iris, providing endless support and empathy. 

When Miki was younger, I was poorly. Of course I did everything I could to support and care for her, and I showered her with all the love in my heart. She is my best friend and always has been. As my health deteriorated, so did my patience and compassion. I became irritable towards Miki, and when things didn’t go to plan I would struggle to pick myself back up. I didn’t understand where her new problems were coming from - so the pressure was raised in regards to Miki’s already intense training.

While away, the one thing that truly kept me going was the thought of bettering myself for my dog. I was desperate to share long walks and camping trips with her - so even if things were a little bumpy, I always kept that vision close.

> Bettering **myself** for my **dog**

Returning home as a better version of myself, I now see that it wasn’t me who was struggling to handle Miki’s problems, but it was Miki who was struggling to handle mine. I am convinced that her anxieties and aggressive tendencies are because she knew something was wrong with me, and her insecurities heightened because of this.

Now I feel that I am able to cope, our bond has only strengthened. I am so thankful for a dog’s ability to forgive and move on, and I know that she’s delighted to have the real me back. 

Of course Miki still has some issues, and so do I. But this time we’re going to work together. As Bruce Willis put it – ‘She’s the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me’.
