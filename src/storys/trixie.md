###Trixie has become a permanent fixture of Sam’s family – and his sofa. 

We adopted Trixie nine years ago from a dog rescue centre. As soon as we met her she was so loving and friendly, we just knew she would be a perfect addition!  

> We just **knew** she would be a **perfect addition**

Nine years and two children later, she is very much a big part of the family. She has a luxurious life, snoozing on the sofa or her favourite chair and then snoring at the end of our bed at night time after a big walk through the woods looking for squirrels! She loves a fuss and a cuddle, and sees it as her job to protect our family.
