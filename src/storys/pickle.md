###Pickle has helped Haelee through a tough time, bringing laughter into her life and even into her office! 

Pickle was the last one in her litter, but even if we had an option we would always have gone for her. She is absolutely the one!  

> She has **never** left my side

She has brought a life to the family and she makes home ‘home’. She recently has helped me to go through the loss of my dad. She has never left my side and has always been the bouncy social butterfly jumpy Pickle. 

We can also take her to the office, where she is helping me to get through this difficult time with my colleagues. I cannot love her enough!
