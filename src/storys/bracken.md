###Bracken has no idea how much his kind nature and unconditional love helps so many, and he makes Hannah proud every day.  

I would best describe Bracken as a happy soul. Full of energy and with a real zest for life, no adventure is too great for this little brown dog. But what Bracken doesn’t know is how much joy she gives so many with her unconditional love and soft cuddles. 

> Her **unconditional** love

I work with vulnerable young people who come from a variety of backgrounds. We run an outdoor learning school which enables young people who are struggling in school to come to us and open their minds to learning in different ways. Bracken is always at the gate ready to welcome them. She’s there all day and they love her, learning how to respect dogs by caring for, feeding, walking and playing with her. 

I can’t count the number of times she’s helped resolve a situation or calm a child. Her unconditional love to so many is what makes her such a special dog. Not to mention, the company and loyalty she gives me. I love her with all my heart, and I feel so blessed to be able to share her incredibly happy soul with our little community.
