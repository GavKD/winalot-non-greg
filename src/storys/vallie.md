###The minute Anthony met his furry friend, Vallie, he knew that life would never be the same again.

The first day I met our dog Vallie was just before Christmas in 2017. Vallie had such a horrible past life. Her story shocked me to my bones and I fell in love with her from day one!

Now Vallie is so out of herself it's great. She’s an ideal weight and looks much happier. She’s able to go for small walks now but she lets me know when she’s tired. Vallie follows me everywhere, we are the best of friends. I give her as much love and attention as I can to make up for her past. Vallie even sleeps in my bed. She tries to get under the covers in between me and my wife whenever she can. It's very funny.

> I **fell in love** with her from **day one**

Vallie makes me smile and laugh every day. She’s adorable and I'd be lost without her. Our family absolutely love her. She now tells me when she’s hungry with a little bark and will do circles near the food cupboard.

Vallie has come a long way now from day one. It took a year for me to gain her trust and now we are inseparable. Vallie is such a loving dog and so kind. Her temperament is amazing and a miracle for what this little lady has been through. She’s a part of a loving family – we could not do without her.
