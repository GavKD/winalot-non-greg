###Jennie joins in with Wiggins’ tennis-ball treasure hunt, making their local community a happy place for all dogs.

Our dog Wiggins does his best to keep the local community of dogs happy! Every day, without fail he finds a tennis ball — we have five separate tennis courts nearby, and there are always stray balls to be found in the park or bushes.  

> Wiggins loves to **sniff** them out

He loves to sniff them out and carry one home each day. We collect them in a large empty flower pot, and then every few months my son and I redistribute the balls by hiding them around the local dog walking areas. Dogs find them and have a great time playing.
