###Ozzy might be friendly but he is also extremely smart, and knows how to show Steve who’s in charge!  

Ozzy is a very friendly dog. His favourite past-time is standing at the gate in the morning watching people going off to work. The best part of his day is seeing the children go to school — we often look out of the window and see him outside with his tail wagging away, so we know there is someone talking to him!  

> I realised what a **clever** dog he is

The first morning we had him, I realised what a clever dog he was. I was sat in my armchair with my toast and coffee, and he tapped on the back door to go out. There I was thinking ‘what a good boy’, and so I opened the door to let him out but he was nowhere to be seen. I turned around to find him sitting in my armchair, with my toast in his mouth! I thought, who’s training who here?
