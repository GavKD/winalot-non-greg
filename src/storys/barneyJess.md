###Jess loves spending time with her dog Barney, who enjoys nothing more than being outside and going on adventures. 


> Makes us **smile** every day

Barney is a one-and-a-half-year-old Cocker Spaniel. He absolutely loves being outdoors and exploring new areas. Since joining my partner and I in December 2018, he has brightened up our lives and brought a new lease of life to our family. He makes us smile every day! 

Extremely friendly, Barney loves to travel and make new friends. He is very special to us.
