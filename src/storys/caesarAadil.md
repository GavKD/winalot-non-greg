###Caesar and Aadil’s relationship proves that man’s best friend really is dog  

Our son (Aadil) has had his heart set on getting a puppy for five years, but up until now we always thought he was too young to look after a dog. He has three sisters and so he’s always felt a bit outnumbered! Once he turned 16 and completed his GCSE exams, we thought he was responsible enough and bought him a German Shepherd puppy. He said that Caesar is the best present he could ever wish for!  

> He’s got a **friend** for **life** 

We got him at only 11 weeks old, and now he’s 6 months and all our children adore him. Our son spends time training him and taking him for a walk before college. When he comes back from college he plays with Caesar and takes him for an evening walk to socialise with other dogs. 

Caesar loves Aadil to bits, and gets so excited to see him. They have a wonderful bond and connection with one another – he’s got a friend for life.
