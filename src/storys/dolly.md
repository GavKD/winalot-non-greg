###Dolly the Bedlington brings equal measures of bedlam and love to Heather's home.

We got Dolly Doo the Bedlington four years ago as a pup. She is so quirky, she thinks she is a hairy human! She likes to come on good, long walks with me. Our favourite walks are along the Morecambe prom early Sunday morning, when it’s quiet. Then when we get home, she lies on top of me on the sofa and snores! 

> She **thinks** she is a hairy **human**!

Bedlingtons are a truly special breed. She has been a delight with my three-year-old grandson, she’s so gentle with him and even tolerates his rough behavior. They chase each other about and play with her toys. 

She does make us laugh, especially when fetching her toys which she knows by name and flinging them everywhere. Her favourite hobby is fly spotting – she loves to chomp a fly but she rarely gets one!
