###Teddy was afraid of his own shadow when he first met Janet. But now he’s bursting with love.

We fostered a few dogs after losing our beloved Wendy Woo in June 2016. Poor Teddy had been so badly abused and treated during the first seven months of his life that he was a bag of nerves when he first came to us. They had tried to foster him somewhere else, but that didn't work out as he was too scared to let any of them near him. So he came to us and was terrified of everything!

Now, however, we would be lost without him. Considering his start in life, he is so loving and giving. He loves nothing more than cuddles at all times of day and night. He is honestly like a naughty toddler at some times and a very funny toddler at other times. We definitely think that Teddy believes he is human!

> We definitely think that Teddy **believes he is human**!

I had to pack in work three years ago due to ill health and he is very protective of me. Quite often we’ll have a nap together in the afternoon. If he wants something, he’ll try to give me his paw and if that doesn't work he will take a couple of steps back, bark at us and look towards where he wants us to go. He is so funny.

It’s remarkable that a puppy who was so badly treated has grown into such a trusting, loving dog who thoroughly loves life.
