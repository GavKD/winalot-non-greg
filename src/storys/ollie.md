###Andrea couldn’t help but to fall for Ollie, the friendliest dog in town.  

Ollie loves people. They often stop to say hello when they see him, and he always gives them a warm welcome. He seems surprised when people pass by without stopping! 

>**Once** we saw **him** that was **it**

We got Ollie our lovely Lurcher from a rescue centre when he was seven months old. We initially just went for a look, planning to get a dog a couple of months later, but once we saw him that was it. He had a nervous car journey home but it did not take him long to settle in, sleeping on my bed for what would be the first of many nights to come. 

It is our job to make Ollie’s life as good as possible, and we love going on adventures together. His favourite thing to do is to explore new places, especially the beach.
