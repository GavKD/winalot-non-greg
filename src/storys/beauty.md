###Beauty had a rough start to life on the streets of Bosnia, but she’s not let that hold her back – and owner Julie couldn’t be more proud.

Beauty spent the first half of her life in Bosnia. I spotted her on a rescue site and fell in love with her. When she arrived, she was very matted and thin – you couldn’t get a lead on her. 

> I **can’t imagine** life without her

We’ve had her for three years now though, and she’s a different dog. She has the most amazing temperament. I signed her up for Therapy Dogs Nationwide and she passed the assessment with flying colours. She now visits schools and old people’s homes. The joy she puts on everyone’s faces, especially mine, is incredible. I can’t imagine life without her.
