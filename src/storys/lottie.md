###Lottie and Paul do the rounds together, helping other people and also enjoying some quality time with one another.  

Lottie came to us via a rescue centre in Nottingham. She was originally a street dog in Romania, and once over here she was on a foster farm for a few weeks. We will have had Lottie five years in February 2020.

> She is incredibly **calm** and very **loving**

Since living with us she has become a therapy dog. We have visited the Royal Derby Hospital on the dementia wards, and Treetops Hospice near Derby — we visit once a week and have been doing so for 14 months. Since I was diagnosed with Parkinsons in 2016, this activity really helps me as well, keeping me active and giving me something rewarding to do. 

Lottie is hugely popular, both with staff and patients. She is incredibly calm and very loving, and she’s also a real character, great fun when we’re out, chasing squirrels and running with other dogs. She also loves to run around our garden with our cat Diesel, they are great friends and make us laugh a lot.
