###Harry and Jasper are the best family that David could ask for, reminding him to see the good things in life. 

Harry and Jasper are my two loveable rogue Cockapoo boys.  They came to me shortly after my partner died very suddenly from brain cancer – they have literally saved my life.

> They have literally **saved** my **life**

They are so trusting and loving, and they give me a purpose each morning to get up and keep going.  They love to play - and chew! - and they are always ready to play or to snuggle up when I need a cuddle. 

I've realized for the first time just how important dogs are in our lives– the house just doesn't feel so empty with them here.  Now the three of us are a family and I can't imagine being without them!
