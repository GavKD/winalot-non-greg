###Bella is full of life and love, and even though she can be a bit messy, Domine just can’t get enough of her cuddles.   

Bella is an absolutely bonkers sprocker spaniel. We got her after we lost our daughter during childbirth and she has literally changed our lives. Full of boundless energy and cuddles she puts a huge smile on everyone’s face wherever she goes. She enjoyed her first trip to France a few years ago, which she thought was fab although her French was rubbish! 

> I absolutely **adore** her

I absolutely adore her, even though she’s always creating a mess! I think everyone should have a Bella in their lives. Until you own a dog you probably don’t understand the pure joy they bring into your lives.
