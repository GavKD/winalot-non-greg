###Jennifer instantly felt a connection with Duke, and now life is going swimmingly for the pair of them. 

As a Mastiff x Staffy, Duke was stuck in a rescue centre unable to be rehomed, because he was considered an undesirable breed. I saw him purely by chance, and it was instant love. He has a real connection with people and adores children. He is so uniquely special, people are drawn to him wherever we go. 

> He has a real **connection** with **people**

We took him on his first holiday when he had recovered from being in the rescue centre, and it was so uplifting to see him happy. Initially he was very apprehensive of the sea, but he comes on holiday with us every year, and on our last holiday he even learnt to swim for the first time!
