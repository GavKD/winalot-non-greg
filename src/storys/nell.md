###Nell is a mischief maker who loves life (just not farm life), and Helen-Jayne adores her. 

We rescued our beautiful Nell off a farm in January 2019. She is a Red Welsh Collie who was meant to herd sheep, but she was too frightened of them to stay on the farm as a working dog! She came to us timid, frightened and confused, with heartbreakingly sad eyes. We had been looking for a dog for a while, but the moment we saw a picture of her, we knew she was the dog for us.  

> She is **bursting** with life

When we first adopted her, she was lethargic and not interested in doing much. Ten months on and she is fully house trained, great on recall but more importantly she is bursting with life, joy, endless energy and overflowing with cheekiness! 

She loves to go to the beach to splash in the sea. She is a mischievous tinker who will help herself to anything! She’s a cheeky madam who loves to make as much noise as possible with her squeaky ball. She has fallen in love with us and we are besotted with her. She has transformed our lives for the better, we couldn’t be without her.
