###Dylan came into Nicole’s life when she needed him most, and now he helps make every day that little bit brighter.   

This is Dylan the dog. He is my 18-month-old puppy and my absolute best friend! He loves chasing his tail, running after squirrels and dinnertime! I don’t want to make this a sob story, but my parents let me get Dylan in 2018 when my mental health was at rock bottom. Since having this crazy, golden puppy in my life, I haven’t stopped smiling! 

> I haven’t stopped **smiling**

We don’t need a doorbell in our house, because Dylan howls like a wolf whenever someone walks past our window… or when a cat runs by… or a leaf blows about… 

Dylan has transformed my family and changed our lives for the better. He is so loved.
