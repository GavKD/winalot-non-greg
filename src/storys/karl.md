###Following a family bereavement, Emma found support in her adventurous pup.

After losing my dad to cancer two years ago, I was at a loss with what to do with my life, despite being at university. Then, when my dog passed away overnight, I felt depressed, reclusive and unable to put my trust in anyone, except my mum.

> He has **completely** changed my **outlook** on **life**

That was, until Karl the Beagle came along. Karl has completely changed my outlook on life and made me appreciate every day we have together. Since the day I brought him home from Carlisle as a puppy, he has been the reason I get up in the morning.

Karl is the best friend I could ever ask for. We are always going on daily adventures, whether to Scotland, the Lake District, the local beach or the woods. We have fun regardless of where we end up, and I love to spoil him.
