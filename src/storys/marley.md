###Marley has helped Carly through a tough time, bringing a new lease of life into the family and encouraging everyone to get outside and explore   

We had always talked about getting a dog as a family pet, but in August this year, it finally happened. I tragically lost my dad in March and have struggled to cope, and my partner believed a dog, a new member of our family, would help me to get through my grief. 

> A **new** best friend

Well, Marley has certainly settled in well with our family. Our two children have a new best friend, and my partner and I have a new passion for going out on walks to new locations with our lively Cocker Spaniel!
