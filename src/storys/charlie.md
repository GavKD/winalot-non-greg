###Like many, Joanne has found self-isolating a struggle. But with Charlie’s furry bear hugs to count on, she never feels alone.

Charlie was not my first choice for a four-legged companion. In fact, he ran out of his kennel and literally bowled me over on a visit to a re-homing kennel to see a much smaller terrier dog almost a decade ago.

He chose me and it didn’t take a lot for me to choose him. Since that day he has been my loyal friend.

> He has been my **saviour** in sad times and made me **happy countless times**

During self-isolation, he has been cherished all the more for his companionship. And despite a recent illness, he has not complained once.

Charlie seemed to know when his furry bear hugs were needed and hardly left my side. He is still as giddy as the day I got him. He doesn’t seem to have aged a year. Strangers on walks will comment on how cute he is, and are shocked that he is no longer a puppy.

He has been my saviour in sad times and made me happy countless times. I do not know where I would be without him and I hope that I have made his life happy too.
