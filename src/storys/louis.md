###There’s never a dull day for Carolynn now that Louis is around to keep her busy, stealing socks and causing mischief!  

Louis aka Goofball is such a character. He is only two but has been through two surgeries for his cruciate ligament tear and has put up with eight months of walking on the lead without his usual running around. 

> Has a **thing** about **socks**

He loves to eat grass (what dog doesn’t?), chase leaves and only ever barks when he is guarding me or the house! He was a retirement gift from the family to my husband to stop him from being bored. You could never be bored with this loopy hound! 

He also has a thing about socks and if he manages to get hold of one, he disappears under a table hoping you haven’t noticed. Our lives have changed considerably in his two years with us, on most days for the better!
