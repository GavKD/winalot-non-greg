###Maggie makes Angus his favourite food – on the condition of cuddles.

I am originally from Scotland, and we love nothing more than taking Angus to the beach up there. He loves to play with his little blue ball we bought him on the first day we brought him home. He is the most loveable little dog, and enjoys nothing more than getting up beside you for a cuddle.

> He's **funny**, **loveable** and sometimes **stubborn**

Angus has it all, he’s funny, loveable and sometimes stubborn. His favourite food is chicken, which he gets as a treat every now and then. When we’re cooking it for him, he refuses to leave the kitchen, crying until he gets his food!
