###Gail’s passion for life and willingness to learn new things has helped Julie to recover some of her old interests, and become happier in herself.

My border collie Gail is three years old. She just recently had a litter of seven puppies, and she was the most wonderful mum.

Gail is a very clever girl who can do may tricks. She loves to play with my two grandsons, although she is loved by people of all ages. I lived alone for many years before I bought her at only four months. Gail has changed my life in so many ways – she has lifted me out of depression and anxiety.

> Gail has **turned** my life **around**

We started to go to obedience training and competitive shows all around UK on the weekends. She went from novice to top class in just over one year! I did competitive obedience over 15 years ago with my other border collie, but my marriage ended and I stopped any sort of training. Having Gail has taken me back to doing something I love.

Gail has turned my life around and turned me back into the person I was many years before. From staying home and not seeing any body or going anywhere, she has brought me back to the happy person I was before.
