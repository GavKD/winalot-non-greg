###Danielle is currently battling cancer, and although she’s surrounded by friends and family, no one offers support quite like Bella.

Where do I begin about my beautiful Bella?

When people say a dog is a man's best friend, she certainly lives up to that and more! Bella is a bundle of joy and energy. She loves people, dogs and, most importantly, her ball! She is turning four this April and is certainly looking forward to her birthday party and cake!

> Bella is my **shoulder to cry on**

At just 19, in May 2018 I was diagnosed with cancer. She was my only companion for a while as I adjusted to being at home a lot of the time, missing out on friends and family. While I’m still going through cancer treatment, Bella is my shoulder to cry on. She keeps me going on my down days, and is the reason I get up and out every day. Without her, I couldn't imagine how lonely I would be. I have a partner and family around me, but there is nothing better than just sitting with Bella, doing sweet nothing. I feel as though she understands what I'm going through, is happy when I'm happy, sad when I'm sad, but can always put a smile back on my face.

Bella truly is an incredible dog, I couldn't imagine my life without her.
