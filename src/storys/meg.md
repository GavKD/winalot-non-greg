###David and his wife never thought they’d be able to get a dog, but as luck would have it Meg was the perfect addition to their family.  

Meg is our two-year-old Cockapoo. We had always wanted a family dog, but due to my wife’s allergies it was never possible until a chance encounter with a friendly Cockapoo while out walking. 

> We can’t **imagine** life **without** her

My wife would normally get an immediate reaction after stroking any dog, but on this occasion, she was fine. So, we decided to visit a couple of Cockapoo litters from local breeders and found to our delight, my wife didn’t have a reaction. We got Meg from our friends who were breeders and she has been an amazing addition to our family, we can’t imagine life without her now. We love coastal walks with her, especially in West Wales with miles of path and fantastic dog-friendly beaches.
