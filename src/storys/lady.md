###Gemma had a dog-shaped hole in her life, and when she found Lady it was like it was meant to be. Although it hasn’t always been smooth, some things are worth fighting for. 

Lady started out life as a Cypriot street-dog, before being rescued by amazing folk at Dali. She was flown to the UK six years ago, ready to start her new life. It was going really well for the first couple of years until her adoptive family could no longer look after her, and she was sent back to the kennels. 

Over the following 18 months, she was adopted several times, but always ended up being sent back. During this time, she developed dog fear and aggression, so many people felt that they couldn’t manage her. 

> Things worth **fighting** for are rarely easy

Having lost my previous rescue the summer before, I was bereft, with a dog-shaped hole in my life. I found Lady on a rescue page and immediately set about my plan to rescue her. we were told she was having intensive training and would be ready in three months time.  The date arrived and we collected her from the Cotswold Kennels where she was living. 

Unfortunately, on arriving home I found her fear and aggression issues still very much intact, so returned with her to the kennel for some training. Sadly, I discovered that this involved using prong and shock collars – needless to say, we didn’t stay and Lady came home with me. We have tried behavioural training but it’s been a long and difficult road. 

Lady has now been with me for over two years. She has taught me to never give up and that things worth fighting for are rarely easy. She is my loyal shadow, sleeping by my bed and even sitting on the bathroom floor while I bathe. On the days that I’m struggling with my physical or mental health she is there for a cuddle or to get me out for fresh air and exercise. She is beautifully gentle and patient with my three-year-old son. Although she still has issues with other dogs, I couldn’t imagine my life without her.
