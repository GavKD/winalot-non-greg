###Lucy always knew she wanted a Dalmatian, and even though Leo can be hard work, his loving nature and loyalty means he’s worth it. 

I’ve grown up with Weimaraners but since watching 101 Dalmatians, I’ve longed for one literally for as long as I can remember! 

The year I graduated from university felt like the right time to get my first Dally. Leo was born on the 22nd of February which is the same as my best friend’s birthday! He came to his forever home at the end of April, right in time for me studying for my final year exams. How I managed to get a first in my degree I’ll never know – maybe it was puppy stress relief? 


> The most **loving** dog

So here I have my perfect pup and he even has a patch like in the movies! I was keen to go to the puppy parties, puppy training and dally rallies with him, but unfortunately, we soon found out he was quite a nervous and sensitive dog, causing him to be a reactive pup. 

We’ve worked with a behaviourist from when he was very young. He was getting so much better and then shortly after his first birthday, he started knuckling his back leg. He was diagnosed with an FCE which is essentially a stroke of the spine. The only treatment available was physiotherapy which meant a long recovery for Leo – he’s still not 100%! 

 This has caused us more difficulty in working on his socialisation and we feel like he’s more dog reactive now but are still working on this. You see so many Dalmatians in the rescue centres as they are ‘hard work’ and Leo definitely isn’t easy. However, he is the most loving dog I’ve ever known. He loves to love and never leaves my side. 

He’s also a very talented dog – he loves to sing, with Take That, Abba and Queen being some of his favourite songs to howl to!
