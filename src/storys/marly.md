###Will’s parents have been comforted by their canine companion during some tough times.

Marly has been with our family since my brother and I were kids – she came to us from a shelter around 12 years ago.

> She **loves** grassy **walks** (but not for too **long**!)

Because she's a rescue dog we don't really know what breed Marly is, but she's a big fluffy girl who loves grassy walks (but not for too long!), chasing squirrels and snuggling up by the fireplace in winter.

My parents have endured some tough times over the last few years including a car accident and a mugging. I think in a lot of ways my dad and Marly help keep each other fit and going. About two years ago they even had a hip replacement at the same time!
