###Elizabeth always knew that something was missing from her life, and Kirby the Springador filled that hole perfectly. 

We moved to this area about five years ago and I have been quite lonely, going for walks on the beach alone and feeling like it was a bit of a waste when I saw others with their dogs. We promised our sons a dog when we moved into our own house, and we chose Kirby as she was a Springador – we were told Labs were already half-trained and Springers were fun. That was definitely right! 

We took her to puppy training where the trainer fell in love with her and our boys learnt how to teach her all sorts of tricks. Our youngest especially is her favourite and she demands a tummy rub and a cuddle from him first thing in the morning, and again as soon as he gets home from school! 

> I am **no longer** lonely

Kirby now has a group of doggie friends and their owners, as well as non-doggie friends such as the postman, the bin men and the children on the school bus. Kirby even sits and gives them a wave in the mornings! Oh, and of course the bus driver that gives her a treat every day in return for doing a few tricks. 

I am no longer lonely as I have a little friend that follows me around the house all day, sitting at my feet when I am working. When we go out for a walk, we inevitably meet someone to chat to – Kirby always wants to say hello – or we see one of our regular doggie walking pals. I am now much fitter and healthier, hitting my 10,000 steps most days, and feeling the benefits of fresh air, which I’m convinced makes me less likely to pick up illness! 

Kirby has been such a positive influence on our family, I wish we’d got her sooner.
