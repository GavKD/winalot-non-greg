###Samantha has learnt a lot from her dog Mishka, who has taught her to live life to the full and never doubt yourself. 

Mishka is a lovely, friendly, kindhearted British Timber Dog, but when the breeder said that they are amazing family dogs but they steal, they weren't wrong! Whether it be socks from my friends, sausages whilst camping or the post from the letterbox, she’ll go for it! Let’s just say that bribery is a part of life now.

> She **never** gave up

Last August she had to have spinal surgery for lumbosacral disease. To go from an active dog where we run together from 5ks to half marathons to not being able to walk down the end if the street was tough. She lost her soul and it was hard, but she had the surgery and after months of physio and hydrotherapy, we completed our first 5k race post operation. 

She never gave up, whereas we would give in when things got tough. The days I sometimes feel anxious to get out the door I remember where she was, and how far she has come. If she can do it, I need to have that positivity. Anything can change in an instance and you might not get that chance to enjoy something you take for granted. 

She is my positivity every day. Despite whatever she steals, she will always make me smile.
