###Selina has worked hard to nurture Susan into a happy, obedient pup, and it’s worked — that is, unless there’s food on display… 

We adopted Susan from a local rescues shelter and it is the best thing we ever did. She is now our five-year-old son’s best friend and he refers to her as his hairy sister! 

> He refers to her as his **hairy sister!**

Not all moments have been great, for a while we had stained carpets, holes in the garden, chewed toys and her digging of carpets means we have lumpy floors due to no underlay. Thankfully she has stopped her destructive behaviour. 

She has become a very greedy dog lately, and last night our son made the mistake of leaving his food on the table for all of two minutes to come and see me in the other room. I immediately said ‘where’s Susan?’. We both ran into the other room to find she had eaten a whole portion of fish and chips! Reduced calorie diet for this pup for a few days now.
