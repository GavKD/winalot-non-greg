###She might not be a support dog, but Cherry is always by Denise’s’ side making her life a little sweeter. 

Cherry has been my shadow,  my support and my will to keep going. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May and started chemotherapy in June. Cherry instinctively knew something was not right with me, and that I was not my normal self. 

> She is always giving me **cuddles** and **kisses**

She took it upon herself to always stay by my side, even when I went to bed she would fall asleep resting her head on me as if to watch over me. 

Cherry is so loving and she is always giving me cuddles and kisses on my bad days. She won’t even let my other Collie come near me, always pushing him out of the way even though he is 20lbs heavier! She is my emotional support, and without her I don’t know how I would cope with my ongoing treatment.
