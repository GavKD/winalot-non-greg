###There’s nothing scary about Boo and Claire’s beach-cleaning mission.

Our girl Boo is amazing. We live at the beach and while out walking we beach clean. We get to share beautiful sunrises together. Best life ever. 

> We get to **share** beautiful **sunrises** together

On our daily walks, we take her along a path before cutting across the road to the beach. There is a fence with a kissing gate that you have to go through to get out. One day, the fence blew down meaning you could just cut straight across, but she still sat and waited at the gate for weeks! 

I’d say that Boo’s personality is fun loving and she is definitely a mummy’s girl. If I do anything she’s always right there behind me. She’s very strong willed and stubborn, but super-cute.
