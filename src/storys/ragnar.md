###It wasn’t easy when Georgia first rescued Ragnar, but with love and perseverance he has become a happy pup. 

When we rescued Ragnar, he had been in the pound for over a month. He was incredibly skinny and in need of a very good brush as all his fur was falling out and matted. But he ran to us with the biggest smile on his face – we think he knew he was being rescued. 

>He **ran** to us with the biggest **smile** 

Once we got him home, we realised how untrained and unloved he had been. He was nervous to eat, scared of us and altogether not listening, although he was still so loving. We knew we could teach him all that he needed to know. 

Rags worked so hard to learn all the things we’ve taught him and he’s such a good dog now! He sits when he’s told, doesn’t jump up or pull on his lead anymore, and is altogether such a well behaved and loving pup!
