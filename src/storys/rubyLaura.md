###Laura loves her loyal dog Ruby so much – she is her number one follower! 

Ruby has a mind of her own, and a life of her own. She has become very social and loves meeting people – she even has her own Instagram page! American Bulldogs often get bad press, so I love showing what a wonderfully loyal breed they are. 

> She **even** has her **own** instagram **page!**

We got Ruby as a pup, and she has helped us through so much. She’s so cheeky, she’s often getting herself into mischief. If we go to a shop she always jumps up at the counter to say hello! She can definitely be described as strong-willed but loving.
