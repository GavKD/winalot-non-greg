###Frank might not be Sioux’s own dog, but that certainly doesn’t change the great friendship and adventures that they share together.   

Frank is a golden Labrador, and although he isn’t my dog I absolutely adore him! I am a live-in carer, and Frank belongs to the family of the lady I have been caring for. As the family live nearby, I get to spend time with him on each assignment, either dog-sitting or going for walks in the countryside. I get a huge amount of enjoyment in spending time with him. 

> He **gads about** innocently, **making** my day! 

Watching him eating wild berries directly off the bushes, or sneaking up on poor unsuspecting pheasants who take flight, shrieking and squawking in protest, while he gads about innocently, makes my day! He loves splashing around in a stream on one of our walking routes and fishing for rocks or leaves. After a long walk, he usually drops down, exhausted, on top of my feet, thereby ensuring his ears are close enough for a good scratch, and making sure I can go nowhere without him!
