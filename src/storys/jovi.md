###Jovi has been specially trained to assist those who suffer from hearing loss, keeping people like his owner Graham safe and sound.  

Jovi is a two-and-a-half-year-old blue roan and tan show cocker spaniel. He’s a fully trained hearing dog and he has quite simply changed my life. He was trained up by incredible volunteers from the charity Hearing Dogs for Deaf People. Jovi came into my life just over a year ago and I simply cannot remember what life was like before him. 

He alerts me to sounds like the doorbell, alarm clock and fire alarms, as well as bringing awareness to others of my hearing loss. I’m a primary school teacher and Jovi comes to work with me in the classroom. Having him with me when I’m out also spreads awareness of my hearing loss. It’s boosted my confidence in social situations and at work. 

> He has quite simply **changed** my **life**

As a guy in my 20s, hearing loss isn’t a typical thing and Jovi helps me to be more open about my condition. He has also had a positive effect on my mental health. I sleep better knowing that Jovi will alert me. Having Jovi in my life is incredible and I feel so lucky that he is my buddy.
