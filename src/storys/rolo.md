###Rolo was an extremely nervous dog, but when Michael saw his fuzzy ears he knew they’d be a match made in heaven. 

We adopted Rolo from our local rescue centre when she was around 12 months old – she had come to the centre as a stray. We were initially intrigued by Rolo as she was the only dog who didn't come begging us for treats as we walked around. In fact, we almost missed her completely as she hid behind her bed. Thankfully, we just about saw the cutest pair of fuzzy ears which was enough to grab our attention!

> She had **transformed** our **lives**

After a cautious first meeting, it became clear that Rolo suffered from severe nervousness. We knew that, although we would have our work cut out, she had to come home with us as soon as possible.

Once in a settled home, Rolo's personally quickly came out – hilariously stubborn but ever so loyal! Her confidence has come on in leaps and bounds and we were so proud when she won the Most Improved award from her rescue centre a while after we adopted her.

Rolo has her Pet Passport to allow her to travel wherever we do. She even took centre-stage at our Lake District wedding, howling to break the silence just as the registrar asked if anyone had any objections. She had transformed our lives, and any travel plans now revolve around her.
