###Katherine loves living with her dog Alice, but when it comes to who’s in charge, Alice is definitely the boss! 

Alice is funny. Really funny, but I don’t think intentionally! She’s a happy dog, but she can sulk, just to let you know that she’s not impressed if you haven’t given her a morsel from your plate, or her walk is 20 minutes later than desired. She can also be quite dramatic. She has been known to limp around just to get carried, and then run full speed when she’s put down again! She’s very clever – she’ll sit, beg, roll and jump. Alice really has a huge personality.

> Alice has a really **huge** personality

Alice has a very weird relationship with the hoover. I’m not quite sure if she loves it or hates it! She likes to think she is protecting us from it, but whenever we get it out she’s on high alert and goes crazy chasing it. It’s so funny to watch. 

She’s completely devoted to us, as we are to her. We don’t let her on the furniture unless there’s a specific red rug on the sofa, and only if invited. So, if I’m sat down in the evening, she’ll come over and just stare at me. I’ll invite her up of course and we spend the evening cuddling.
