###Emily feared the worst when she discovered that Summer had cancer, however she fought through it and is now back to her happy, healthy self. 

My gorgeous black Labrador Summer has been through it all. She has suffered with hip dysplasia since she was a puppy, and three years ago we got the dreaded news that she had cancer. It was devastating to deal with as she is a huge part of the family. 

> She has **defied** all **odds**

She had to undergo traumatic surgery to remove half of her lower jaw. The vets and surgeon told us she would never be able to carry around a football (her favourite toy) and would struggle to pick up any other soft toy. For Summer this would be heart-breaking, as she likes nothing more than to carry her football around the garden. After her surgery came the long process of recovery. 

Now that half her jaw has gone, her little tongue has nowhere to rest so itâ€™s constantly out, which makes her look even more adorable in my opinion. Three years later and I am so happy to say that she has defied all odds, and six months after her surgery she was eating, playing and most importantly carrying around her beloved football in the garden. This shows her incredible resilience. Summer is such a loyal dog and she is known all around our village, I am so glad to still have her here today.
