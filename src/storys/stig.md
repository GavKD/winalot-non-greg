###Roz was reassured to see that Pip and Stig have each otherâ€™s backs.

My elderly dog Stig was paddling in the water by a ditch when he fell in. I was so worried because although he can swim he is pretty blind and deaf, and couldnâ€™t hear me calling to him. 

Suddenly my lab Pip jumped in and guided him round, then stayed right behind him as he scrambled up the bank! It was amazing to witness.
