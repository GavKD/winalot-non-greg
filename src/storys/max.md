###Although Lucy has always loved dogs, she didn’t think it would be possible for her to own one – luckily, Max was the perfect fit. 

Max is a seven-month-old standard schnauzer. Although he’s only young, people often think he’s older because his beard and eyebrows make him look like a little old man! 

> Our **lives** are much **fuller**

I’d always grown up with dogs but my partner was allergic. One day while we were away in Norfolk, we met a couple of schnauzers and realised that he wasn’t allergic to that breed – three months later Max came into our life! 

He’s made our house a home and our lives are much fuller. He’s full of energy and super bouncy - his favourite thing to do at home is chew his antler bone and then every few chews chuck it in the air and see where it ends up! As you can see from the photo, Max loves being at the seaside, especially playing fetch and chasing the waves.
