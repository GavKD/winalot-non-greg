###Henry is so much more than a dog to Lauren – he helped her through a tough time and is her inspiration to be as kind and happy as he is.     

Henry is just the absolute best. He is so happy go lucky all the time and you just can’t stay in a bad mood around him. He actually makes me want to be a better person and be more like him. 

> Makes me want to be a **better** person 

He loves nothing more than jumping in any body of water for a swim, whether it be a lake, river or ocean... Yet he somehow hates bath time, go figure!

I recently had a miscarriage and went through a very rough time. He was there cuddled up with me for every tear and encouraged me to get up and get moving again. This dog is so much more than a dog, he is literally our child and we love him more than life itself.
