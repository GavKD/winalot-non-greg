###Patch the Staffy has made a huge difference to owner Julia’s life as she copes with disability.

After back surgery for a slipped disc, which was unsuccessful, my husband thought that adopting a dog would help me to cope with my pain and disability. 

Patch is quite simply my emotional prop and constant company to help me through each day. As anyone who knows about Staffies will say, she is very caring and affectionate, and not at all like they can be portrayed by the press. I don't know what I'd do without her.
