###Pocky’s happiest when surrounded by water — that is, unless Caroline is trying to give him a shower! 

Pocky is a Staffy, he doesn’t care about other people or other dogs, only his pack (us food suppliers) and his next greatest love is water. He loves the ocean, he loves rivers, but strangely not the shower!  

> He **loves** the ocean

Pocky is old and slightly arthritic on the outside, but very young on the inside. We live in Cornwall and he does visit the beach regularly. We have always said the perfect holiday for Pocky would be one where he could wake up in the morning and be running in the sand in seconds.
