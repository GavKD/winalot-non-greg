###After Sharon rescued Bobby, it didn’t take long for him to settle right into the family.

We got Bobby Dog from Romania three years ago. He was around 18 months old and scared. We picked him up from Leicestershire and brought him home. All the way he watched my daughter Willow and slowly moved nearer to her. 

> He has made a **special bond** with my **son**

When we got home we introduced him to our dog Chocolate, who thank God, loved him. Slowly over time he has made a special bond with my son Harvey. They do everything together. Bobby trusts him to the hilt, he sleeps with Harvey and just loves him to bits. It’s taken time but we now have a very happy member of our family.
