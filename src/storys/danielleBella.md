###Life has dealt Danielle some tough cards, but with her faithful companion Bella by her side, she knows that she can get through anything.

People say that a dog is a man's best friend, and Bella certainly lives up to that and more! She is a bundle of joy and energy and loves people, dogs and most importantly... her ball!!!!

In may 2018 I was diagnosed with cancer even though I was only 19. She was my only companion for a while as I adjusted to being home a lot of the time, missing my friends and family. She is my shoulder to cry on as I am going through all my treatments. She keeps me going on my down days, and is the reason I get up and out every day. Without her, I couldn't imagine how lonely I would be.

> She keeps me **going** on my **down** days

I have a partner and family around me, but thereâ€™s nothing better than just sitting with Bella, just enjoying doing nothing. I feel as though she understands what I'm going through, is happy when I'm happy, sad when I'm sad, and can always put a smile back on my face.

Bella truly is an incredible dog, and I couldn't imagine my life without her.
