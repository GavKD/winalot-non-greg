###Eve and her family fell in love with Norman at first sight, and now he is a happy member of their family. 

Norman was rescued from the streets of Romania. He travelled all the way to the UK in a van with about eight other dogs to a rescue centre, to be given the chance at a better life as part of a loving family. As soon as we saw Norman’s photo, we knew we had to meet him! 

> A real **zest** for life

The night before, we were so excited and nervous. We took him home with us the very same day we met him, as we were in love with him from the word go! Norman is a fun-loving, affectionate boy with a real zest for life. He was nervous at first but has come out of his shell and developed into a wonderful companion. We’re so lucky to have him, and we hope he feels lucky to have us!
