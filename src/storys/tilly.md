###Carli was willing to try anything to nurse Tilly back to health, but she didn’t expect hummus to be the best medicine…   

In 2018, Tilly contracted severe Leptospirosis. She was so poorly and losing weight rapidly. The vet’s main concern was that Tilly was so weak and needed to eat. I went out and bought her all her favourite food, in vain I tried everything, but to no avail. 

> Tilly always loved **hummus!**

Then it hit me, the one thing she really loved to eat off my finger – hummus! I rushed to the kitchen and came back with a pot and crawled under the bed beside her. I didn’t know if it would work or whether she could even fight this nasty disease, but Tilly always loved hummus. I put a tiny bit on my finger and gave it to her. She licked my finger clean! I gave her some more and before we knew it, she’d eaten a quarter of a pot. 

By the morning she had snuck downstairs and eaten the cat’s food, so I knew she was on the mend. More than a year on and you would never know she had been sick. She’s her normal, lovable self and still loves hummus. I would have tried anything that night and I did. My vet couldn’t believe the transformation in her when I took her back. I was wary to admit to her that I’d weaned Tilly back to health with hummus, but hey! Tilly wouldn’t be here today without it.
