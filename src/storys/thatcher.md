###Even on gloomy days, Mel can’t help but melt when she sees Thatcher’s big puppy dog eyes.

Thatcher is my ray of sunshine. No matter how bad my day is she makes it all better.

When she was younger she had parvovirus and was in isolation at the vets for 11 days. She was a fighter. Life has dealt her some tough cards: she had a tumour removed, she has serious problems with her eyes and suffers from pyrometra. But she thankfully has pulled through it all.

She is the softest, gentlest dog I have ever known and she absolutely loves kids. My brother’s kids adore her and she feels the same way about them. When they were babies, she would lay next to them protectively when they were in their baby seats. And she would soothe them when they were upset by gently nuzzling into them.

My favourite traits of hers are the way she tilts her head when she’s listening to you, showing her lovely wrinkles. I love the way she crawls along the floor like a soldier and how excited she gets if she sees a shiny reflection or light anywhere. She is so well behaved too, which is a bonus. And everyone that meets her adores her. I just love her company.
