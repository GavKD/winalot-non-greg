###Duke used to enjoy epic adventures on his own, but now he’s settling down into family life with Kymberley.

This is the very handsome Dukey bear. He loves long walks, treats, chicken and dinner. But he absolutely hates water and his chin being touched. The reason we decided to rescue him was because my partner was working long weeks away and I suffer with my mental health. Duke has been such a positive role model and influence. It’s like he just knows when I’m having an off day and will comfort me. He’s definitely the most human dog I’ve ever known.

> He is such a **delight** to have **around**

When he first came to us he was such a naughty boy. He would eat and chew up anything that was left around and would often jump our fence to go on Lassie-style adventures. He’s much more placid now and he fits in with our family so well. He’s such a happy boy who loves to sleep in our bed – although he hogs the pillow and snores! He is such a delight to have around and I’m so pleased we rescued him three years ago. He really has changed our lives for the better and for that I can’t thank him enough.
